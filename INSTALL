Please refer to the documentation for full installation notes : doc/sympa.pdf

Reference manual
===============
This document is only a quick start.
For detailed installation / setup information, refer to the reference manual :

	http://www.sympa.org/wiki/manual


Installing Sympa from sources
=============================

(If you get sources from cvs tree first run: automake; aclocal ; autoconf)

Create a dedicated user sympa.sympa (and it's home directory) and  run 

./configure; make; make install.  (you may have to use Gnu make).

If usefull, the make will propose that you upgrade some CPAN module.
In this case you'll need to be root.
   

Requirements
=============================

Sympa requires other applications to run :
  * perl and gcc
  * suidperl or sudo (needed to run the web interface with sufficient privileges)
  * sendmail or another MTA (postfix, exim and qmail supported)
  * mysql or another relational database (postgresql, oracle and sybase supported)
  * apache (or another web server)
  * mod_fastcgi or mod_fcgid
  * many perl modules : they are automatically installed at 'make' time
  * some Perl modules require additionnal libraries :
    - XML::LibXML requires libxml2 and libxml2 sources
    - Net::SSLeay requires openssl sources

Setup
==========

1/ Sympa setup
You can edit sympa.conf (and wwsympa.conf) manually or run sympa_wizard.pl that will help
you create your configuration files.

2/ Syslog setup
Default for Sympa is to log in 'local1' (you can configure this in sympa.conf)
You should add the following line to your /etc/syslog.conf file :
	local1.*	/var/log/sympa

On Solaris (7 & 8) and True64, the '.*' level is not recognized in syslog.conf
You need to enumerate levels :
	local1.info,local1.notice,local1.debug /var/log/sympa

3/ MySQL setup
Your MySQL version MUST be at least 4.1 in order to run correctly with Sympa.
db_xxx parameters in sympa.conf refer to your local database. 
Sympa.pl should be able to create this database at runtime ; if it does not you'll
have to create it yourself with the provided create_db.xxx scripts and provide
read access to Sympa.

4/ Mail aliases setup
Sympa will use a dedicated alias file for its own mail aliases, default is /etc/mail/sympa_aliases.
You have to configure your MTA (sendmail/postfix,...) to use this file.
You should also create the main Sympa aliases ; they will look like this :
	sympa: "| /home/sympa/bin/queue sympa@my.domain.org"
	listmaster: "| /home/sympa/bin/queue listmaster@my.domain.org"
	bounce+*: "| /home/sympa/bin/bouncequeue sympa@my.domain.org"
	sympa-request: postmaster
	sympa-owner: postmaster

(Later mailing lists aliases will be installed automatically by Sympa)

5/ Web setup
You should add these lines to your httpd.conf file :

   Alias /static-sympa /home/sympa/static_content 
   ScriptAlias /sympa /home/sympa/bin/wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi

   <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
     AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
   </IfModule>

To login with listmaster privileges, you should login on the web
interface with the email address you declared in sympa.conf. To get an
initial password just hit the "First login" button.
