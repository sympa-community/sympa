        no login form is needed at all.

        data structure for list configuration. You must check that sympa.sympa
        has write access on config files.

        sophie.le-floch AT cru.fr is intended for new groupware features
        in WWSympa.

      Illegal division by zero at /var/sympa/bin/List.pm line 751

      "bouncequeue" program accesses sympa.conf to locate "queuebounce" directory.
      There is no more default value for "queuebounce" (and "queue") in
      Conf.pm.

      Sympa died while parsing a template, it could not connect to an unknown
      database type :
      Can't connect(DBI::dbname=sympa;host=  ), no database driver specified 
      and DBI_DSN env var not set at /home/sympa/bin/List.pm line 216

      [Patrick BROSSIER <Patrick.Brossier AT mgm.fr>]
      Make of cn-gb and cn-big5 catalogs failed because of \" ending lines.


     New features :
     
      scenari can contain include directive. If a scenario contain 
      the line include foo
      the scenario will load the file include.foo according to the
      location preference. This is introduce in order to share
      various rules by deffernt scenario in order to made liter
      administration. Can be use for example to manage a blacklist.
    

     Changes :

      Sympa will not die if NLS catalogue version is different
      from Sympa version.

     	You may use Sympa with Oracle databases.
     	Major differences between Oracle and MySQL :
	- connection string uses a sid instead of a dbname
	- $dbh->tables() function doesn't work, a SELECT is performed
	instead
	- no oracle equivalent for UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), a tricky formula
	is used instead
	- no "AS" in SELECT
	- there are case problems with table names
	- "date" is a keyword ; it needs to be quoted

     	New parameter "wwsympa_url" in sympa.conf. Default is

	Host added to listnames when doing a LISTS

	Store bounces info (<first_bounce> <last_bounce> <number_of_bounces>) 
	in database (bounce_user in user_table)

****** You need to change your mysql/pgsql database structure:
****** ALTER TABLE subscriber_table ADD bounce_subscriber varchar (30);
****** ALTER TABLE subscriber_table ADD update_subscriber datetime;
****** ALTER TABLE user_table CHANGE lang_user lang_user varchar (10);

	Default value for "user_data_source" list parameter is
	"database" when defining db_xxx parameters in sympa.conf.

     	Sympa supports templates for global service messages ("helpfile",
     	"lists") as well as list service messages ("welcome", "bye", "removed",
     	"reminder","invite"). These files have a ".tpl" extension. Global ones
     	are located in ~sympa/etc/templates/, list specific in ~sympa/expl/<list>/ 
     	directory. Compatibility with old-style files (in ~sympa/expl/) 
     	is maintained. 
     	Templates begining with a From: line are considered as full
     	messages, no header is added (except To:).

     	[reported by Vincent Jardin <jardin AT enst.fr>]
     	When parsing an empty header field, it cleans it up and deletes 
     	the carriage return (\n) at the end of the field. When printing 
     	the Mail::Internet header, this \n is missing.
     	A patch (patch.mailheader) has been proposed by the author of 
     	Mail::Internet

     	[reported Richard Balint <richard.balint AT notes.udayton.edu>]
     	Sympa died when openning an unknown scenario. Fixed by adding a
     	default in the code which always return "reject"

     	[reported by Emmanuel POIRET <E.poiret AT edf.fr>]
     	Whitespaces are not cleaned at the end of a command (reported

	Translation of titles and filenames to english

	Add now accepts gecos

	Default values for config parameters.

	Some templates have been translated. Lang user pref is now used.

	Usage of language information sent by the client (HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE)
	to initialize lang_user field in database.

	Privileges of the user (user/editor/owner/listmaster)have been added 
	to the menu.

     	Scenari for send parameter are available ! Check send.* in the 
     	scenari directory. The send scenari is paticular because you can
     	check headers in rules :  exemple.
      	  match ([header->Content-Type],/multipart/)  smtp -> editorkey
          (semantic is multipart messages must be approved by editor)

     	The list parameter "visibility" is performed by scenari. The goal
     	is to provide defferent lists of lists depending of the context
     	(mainly depending on the sender). The following exemple show how
     	to use visibility scenario in order to provide intranet lists

     	visibility 
       	 match ([sender],/cru\.fr/)  smtp -> do_it

	edit message, only listmaster can.
	
	Regexp in "search" are made simple : only "*" wild character
	is supported.

	main.tpl has been split, each action has .tpl file
	this should make internationalization easier

	Subroutines' parameters are now logged

	User email and list added to the log

	Search matches sub-strings

	<PRE> added to info if not HTML

     	Notification of sender when message is forwarded to editor

     	Contacting owners if no editor is defined

     	From field (SYsteme de MultiPostage Automatique) is in NLS

     	Documentation has been updated and slightly reorganized.

     	Moderation key has been added to the log at allocation,
     	distribution or rejection.

     	Default value for send is set to 'private'

     	Now scenario optionaly include title.<lang> <string> in order to
     	print the scenario title in wwsympa (edit_list_request and info)
     	This is compatible with old scenari style
	
   Bug Fixes :

	Editfile & Savefile were not working in 0.3.2 because of

     	It tries to create a "sympa"list object. This bug had no consequences
     	on Sympa behaviour.

     	Remind command did not work with lists in database mode.

     	[reported by "Frederic ALLIOD" <falliod AT jetmultimedia.fr>]
     	This occures when sending a message to an email address beginning
     	with a "-". When invoking sendmail, this is considered by sendmail

      	of aliases) by «priority» parameter. New (optional) parameters
      	in sympa.conf : «sympa_priority» and «default_list_priority». 
      	Changes in aliases : no more priority param is needed
      	(though old style remains compatible)

      	[proposed by Carsten Clasohm]

      	"message.header"[.mime] appended at the beginning of messages.

      	Commands del, add, sig, rev, info are now controled by scenari
      
*****  New syntax for condition in scenario rules.
***** This will affect your scenari if you write your own scenari
***** in previous versions. If so, check scenari from src/scenari dir.

      
    Changes :
       
      	[reported by Carsten Clasohm <clasohm AT rivalnet.com>]
      	Table names "user" and "subscriber" respectively become
      	"user_table" and "subscriber_table". This is needed because
      	of a conflict with "USER" keyword in PostgreSQL v 6.4
      	(Define USER as synonym for CURRENT_USER per SQL92 specs).

****** You need to change your database structure:
****** with MySQL :
******    ALTER TABLE user RENAME user_table;
******    ALTER TABLE subscriber RENAME subscriber_table;
******
****** with PostgreSQL :
******    ALTER TABLE user RENAME TO user_table;
******    ALTER TABLE subscriber RENAME TO subscriber_table;

      	~expl/[listname]/remider or ~expl/remider.mime or ...

      	Messages welcome, removed, bye, reminder are parsed 
      	at runtime for variables instanciation. The following keystring
      	are parsed :
      	[listname] [subscriber_email] [sympa_email] [sympa_host]

****** So you need to update your helpfile and create
****** helpfile.advanced, look in sample dir

      	"user_data_source include" allow multiple include sections

      	new include type :  include_list [listname]
                          include_file [path to a file]

      	parameter "unsubscription owner" is recognized

      	New fields added to the database :
	  lang_user
	  cookie_delay_user
****** You need to change your mysql database structure:
****** ALTER TABLE user ADD cookie_delay_user  int,
******                  ADD lang_user	  char (5);


      	Better management of error codes (undef|1) thoughout 
      	do_commands procedures.

      	Message body is ignored if a command is found in the subject

    Bug Fixes :

      	; files sent (welcome, bye,...) are from <listname>-request.
            

2.2.5	18 may 1999


      	"subscription" list parameter is now "subscribe" for simplification
      	("subscription" and "unsubscription" are still accepted).

      	Lists subject returned by LISTS was truncated to 4 lines. It is now
      	extended to 8 lines.

      	List params "reply-to" and "custom-header" are changed to "reply_to"
      	and "cutom_header" ; previous syntax will still be recognized.

      	Creation of new susbscribers file is logged.

      	Safefork now waits longer before giving up.

	    + visibility [ conceal | noconceal ]
	    + subject 
	You can although define a header (lists.header) and footer 
	(lists.footer). Location of these files are defined in sympa.conf.

        [ Olivier LACROIX <Olivier.Lacroix AT ciril.fr> ]
        default_user_options per/list parameter to define a profile
	for subscribers (reception & visibility).	

        [ Laurent Ghys <Laurent.Ghys AT ircam.fr> ]
	Sympa now checks if NLS version have been updated (if not  => exit).

      Corrections :
      
	[ Laurent Ghys <Laurent.Ghys AT ircam.fr> ]
	Documention refers to Perl 5.004_03 as a prerequisite

        [ Laurent Ghys <Laurent.Ghys AT ircam.fr> ]

	The nls/ directory include us.msg and fr.msg (us.msg was proposed
	by Stephane Alnet).
	
      New feature :

        -for each list config file, you can chose to notify
	 owner for each subscription and/or unsubscribtion
	 using parameters :
	           subscribtion [open|auth],notify
	           unsubscribe  [open|auth],notify
		  
        - Allow option "reception nomail" in owner and editor definition.
	  usefull to define multiple address of one privilegied person.
	
        - Add sympa version number at the end of command  «HELP» result.
	
	- Allow file bienvenue.mime insteed of bienvenue. In this case

        Correction dans la numérotation des messages de fr.msg.

1.3.4	22 décembre 1998

	Les "digest" sont au format MIME, il faut maintenant installer

	Quelques petits défauts de corrigés.

1.3.3	10 décembre 1998

	Nouvelle option log_socket_type dans sympa.conf pour choisir la
	journalisation via UDP ou un socket Unix.

	La limite "anti-commandes" passe de 20 lignes à 15 lignes dans le
	corps du message (c'était vraiment pénible).

	On peut maintenant utiliser DESTDIR. Exemple :
		make install DESTDIR=/mnt
	Le nom DESTDIR est préfixé au répertoire DIR du fichier Makefile
	(proposition de Raphaël Hertzog).
	
	Nouvelle fonction : on peut dorénavant mettre des commandes dans
	le fichier sympa.conf. Exemple :
		host	`cat /etc/hostname`
	(proposition de Raphaël Hertzog).

1.3.2	18 septembre 1998

	Avec certaines versions de l'interpéteur Perl, "smtp.pm::reaper"
	ne se comportait pas correctement.

	IMPORTANT : changement des conditions d'utilisation, de modification
	et de diffusion de Sympa (grosso-modo on adopte GPL) -- ceci afin de
	permette création et la diffusion d'un module Debian sympa.deb.

1.3.1-2	6 juillet 1998

	Restructuration du chapitre 7 (Commands.pm) du catalogue français.
	Ajout d'entête MIME dans les notifications de rejet (contribution

	Journalisation des boucles
	Mise à jour de la détection des commandes dans les messages.

1.3.0	11 juin 1998	Contributions du CRU (Fabien Marquois)

	Nouveautés dans les commandes WHICH, expiration des abonnements,
	diffusion des messages pour les listes modérées, état des messages en
	attente.

	Nouvelles options de configuration : authentification des signatures de
	messages, valeurs privatekey, publickey et privateorpublickey pour le
	paramètre "send" ; paramètres clean_delay_queueauth et queueauth dans
	sympa.conf ; paramètre clean_delay_queue dans sympa.conf ; paramètre
	queueexpire dans sympa.conf ; paramètre clean_delay_queuemod dans

	Corrections de défauts et nouvelles fonctions : plusieurs
	"custom-header", traiter les réponses préfixées par ">",
	présentation en MIME des messages à modérer, accents supprimés
	des journaux (syslog ne sait pas faire), gestion des accents dans
	certaines commandes, journalisation de la durée des commandes.

	Makefile pour générer et installer le catalogue de Sympa.

1.2.1	15 mai 1998	Contributions du CRU (Fabien Marquois)

	Corrections de défauts de la 1.2.0 : review, génération des clés de
	modération.

1.2.0	13 mai 1998	Contributions du CRU (Fabien Marquois)

	Refonte de la documentation : fonctions non encore documentées,
	fichiers de configuration, notes pour certains Unix.

	Nouvelles fonctions : digest, modérator avec editorkey et
	editorkeyonly, commentaires dans les fichiers de configuration,
	liste rouge (conceal, noconceal), nomail, custom-header, tri par
	priorité selon le domaine destination.

	Corrections : problème d'allocation mémoire, mot-clé msgcat pris en
	compte, corrections pour "confirm", fonction stats plus précise,
	problèmes avec les guillements dans le catalogue des messages.

0.011	2 février 1998

	Légers changements dans Makefile (création du répertoire bin qui
	n'était pas faite au bon endroit).

	Les commandes add/del ne fonctionnaient pas comme prévu dans certains
	cas à cause d'une erreur de programmation.

	Ajout systématique des entêtes MIME du catalogue des messages (si elles
	sont définies).

0.010   27 janvier 1998

	Modifications dans le fichier fr.msg -> il faut refaire le catalogue
	avec "gencat".

	Les commandes add/del permettent l'usage de l'authentifieur MD5. Pour
	cela il faut que le propriétaire de la liste ait "auth md5" dans le
	fichier de configuration.

	Une erreur dans Archive.pm mettait des dates fantaisistes dans la date
	de création d'une archive.

	On journalise la durée de l'envoi des messages ainsi que le nombre de
	sessions SMTP.

	Gestion des entêtes MIME (à définir à la fin de fr.msg).

0.009   10 décembre 1997

	Correction d'une erreur dans les expressions régulières de gestion des
	commandes : cela pouvait faire échouer l'usage de l'authentifieur dans
	certains cas très rares.

	Ajout de l'entête X-Loop et traitement visant à prevenir les boucles.

	Erreur dans le total du nombre d'abonnés : l'ajout d'un utilisateur
	n'était pas comptabilisé.

	Reply List ne fonctionnait pas dans certains cas en raison d'une faute
	de programmation.

0.008	15 novembre 1997

	Corrigé quelques bugs et rajout de l'option maxsmtp dans sympa.conf.

0.007   10 novembre 1997

	La modération était en avance sur son temps : on revient à la (mauvaise)
	vieille méthode (AtArticle to modérate).
	Corrections mineures dans les autres modules.
	Le fichier fr.msg a été corrigé et étendu.

0.006   15 septembre 1997

	Beaucoup de changements dans de nombreux modules, notamment un
	début d'écriture en objet pour certains d'entre eux. Quelques
	corrections de défauts. A se demander si on ne devrait pas
	appeler cela une béta de la version 2 de Sympa.


0.005	8 juillet 1997

	version.pl -> Version.pm      log.pl -> Log.pm

	La commande `get' fonctionne enfin.

	Certaines fonctions passent du module `tools' vers `list' où elles
	sont mieux à leur place.

	Bug dans list.pl lorsque le fichier des abonnés n'existe pas il faut
	refuser de charger la liste [signalé par Olivier Lacroix].

	La substitution remplace également le chemin vers le fichier de
	configuration définit dans le Makefile. Cela fonctionnait déjà
	pour le programme queue, mais par pour sympa.pl [O. Lacroix].

0.004	17 juin 1997

	La documentation évolue un peu.

	La commande reconfirm envoie un message aux abonnés qui n'ont pas
	confirmé leur abonnement à la liste depuis le délais indiqué en
	paramètre. Le troisième argument est le nombre de semaines de
	grâce (donné à titre indicatif). Ex : reconfirm tulp-fr 2 4.

	La commande purge permet de virer les abonnés qui n'ont pas
	renouvellé leur abonnement depuis le nombre de mois indiqué
	en argument. Ex : purge tulp-fr 2.

	L'authentification est maintenant supportée pour les commandes
	sub et sig : il faut mettre le drapeau `auth' dans le champ
	subscription du fichier de configuration (et non pas md5).

	Le paquettage MD5 (dans CPAN) n'est plus facultatif : vous devez
	l'installer pour utiliser Sympa.

	Correction de quelques bugs dans la gestion des entêtes
	[A. Thivillon].

0.003	13 juin 1997

	*** ATTENTION - IMPORTANT ***
	Pour utiliser Sympa vous devez installer le paquettage DB de
	Berkeley dans une version supportée par Perl (use DB_File),
	et il vous faut aussi installer MailTools (dans CPAN).

	Correction de 2 petits bugs de programmation [Alain Thivillon].
	Changement de la chaine de reconnaisance what(1) (bug signale
	par O. Robert).

	Utilisation de my a la place de local, usage de my devant $id (pour
	use strict) [O. Robert].

	La fonction "index" a été rajoutée et fonctionne.

	Le tri des abonnés se fait maintenant par un arbre binaire en
	utilisant le module DB_File. C'est beaucoup plus rapide pour
	les grandes listes.

	Le module rfc822.pl n'est plus nécessaire, il a été supprimé de
	la distribution. Le programme utilise maintenant Mail::Address
	(disponible dans CPAN).

0.002	19 mai 1997

	Ajout du nombre d'abonnés à la liste en dernière ligne de la
	commande Review.

0.001	1er avril 1997

	Première version de tests diffusée à un large public.
