=head1 NAME

Sympa::Spindle::ResendArchive - Workflow of resending messages in archive

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sympa::Spindle::ResendArchive;

  my $spindle = Sympa::Spindle::ResendArchive->new(
      resent_by => $email, context => $list, arc => $arc,
      message_id => $message_id);
  $spindle->spin;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Sympa::Spindle::ResendArchive> defines workflow for resending of messages
in archive.

When spin() method is invoked, it reads a message in archive,
decorate and distribute it.
Either resending failed or not, spin() will terminate
processing.

=head2 Public methods

See also L<Sympa::Spindle/"Public methods">.

=over

=item new ( resent_by =E<gt> $email,
context =E<gt> $list, arc =E<gt> $arc, message_id =E<gt> $message_id,
[ quiet =E<gt> 1 ] )

=item spin ( )

new() must take following options:

=over

=item resent_by =E<gt> $email

E-mail address of the user who requested resending message.
It is given by do_send_me() function of wwsympa.fcgi and
used by L<Sympa::Spindle::ToList> to whom distribute message.

=item context =E<gt> $list

=item arc =E<gt> $arc

=item message_id =E<gt> $message_id

Context (List), archive and message ID to specify the message in archive.

=item quiet =E<gt> 1

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

If this option is set, automatic replies reporting result of processing
to the user (see L</"resent_by">) will not be sent.
