=head1 NAME

Sympa::DatabaseDriver - Base class of database drivers for Sympa

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Sympa::DatabaseDriver::FOO;
  use base qw(Sympa::DatabaseDriver);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Sympa::DatabaseDriver> is the base class of driver classes for
Sympa Database Manager (SDM).

=head2 Instance methods subclasses should implement

I<Overridable>.
Returns an arrayref including package name(s) this driver requires.
By default, no packages are required.

=item required_parameters ( )

I<Overridable>.
Returns an arrayref including names of required (not optional) parameters.
By default, returns C<['db_name', 'db_user']>.

I<Note>:
On Sympa prior to 6.2.37b.2, it by default returned
C<['db_host', 'db_name', 'db_user']>.

=item optional_modules ( )

I<Overridable>.
Returns an arrayref including all name(s) of optional packages.
By default, there are no optional packages.

This method was introduced by Sympa 6.2.4.

=item optional_parameters ( )

I<Overridable>.
Returns an arrayref including all names of optional parameters.
By default, returns C<'db_passwd'>, C<'db_port'>, C<'db_options'> and so on.

Parameter:

None.
