[%   ELSIF status == '5.2.3' -%]
[%|loc(msg_size,max_size)%]Your message could not be sent because its size (%1 kB) was over the maximum size (%2 kB) allowed on this list.

Note: Because binary files have to be encoded in less-efficient ASCII format before being sent over email, the final size of an attachment is often significantly larger that the original file.[%END%]

[%|loc(list.name,"${conf.email}@${domain}",domain,cmd)%]The following message was sent to list '%1' and it contains a line '%4' that can be interpreted as a command.

If your message contained a command (like subscribe, unsubscribe, help, index, get, ...), please note that commands should never be sent to lists. Commands must be sent to %2 exclusively.

If your message was really meant to be sent to the list, it was interpreted by the software as a command. Please contact the list owner:
  %1-request@%3
so that they can take care of your message.

Thank you for your attention.[%END%]

Note, however, that many viruses fake sender's e-mail address, so it is possible that the virus didn't come from your computer. In that case, please disregard this message.[%END%]
