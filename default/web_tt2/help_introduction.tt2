<h3>[%|helploc%]What is a mailing list?[%END%]</h3>
<p>
    [%|helploc%]A mailing list is a <strong>distribution list allowing a group of subscribers to automatically receive by email all messages sent to the list</strong>: every message sent to the list by a subscriber is received by all the other subscribers. When subscribed to a mailing list, it is possible to send messages, to reply to them or to read them without contributing (i.e. to "lurk").[%END%]
</p>
<p>
    [%|helploc%]<strong>Special cases:</strong>[%END%]
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        [%|helploc%]It is sometimes possible to send messages to a mailing lit without having subscribed to it. However, you need to be subscribed to a list to receive its messages.[%END%]
    </li>
    <li>
        [%|helploc%]It is sometimes impossible to send messages to the list even though you are actually subscribed to it: it is the case for announcement lists, which are used to transmit information from a unique sender to a large number of recipients.[%END%]
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>[%|helploc%]Types of mailing lists[%END%]</h3>
<p>
    [%|helploc%]There are <strong>thousands of mailing lists</strong> of all kinds on the Internet: public or private, free or not, with subscription subject to conditions or not, etc. Those lists may have from a dozen up to several thousand members.[%END%]
</p>
<p>
    [%|helploc%]According to the way they work, we can distinguish between <strong>two types of lists</strong>:[%END%]
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        [%|helploc%]<strong>Announcements lists</strong> allow subscribers to receive messages without being allowed to post some themselves. In fact, those messages are newsletters: electronic magazines, daily services (daily horoscope, daily weather report, daily security alert, etc.), update notices about a website, etc. With this type of mailing list, the information flows from a unique sender to a large number of recipients.[%END%]
    </li>
    <li>
        [%|helploc%]<strong>Discussion lists</strong> allow all subscribers to take part in exchanges. Those lists can be moderated or not:[%END%]
        <ul>
            <li>
                [%|helploc%]In a <strong>moderated discussion list</strong>, messages are transmitted to all subscribers after approval by one of the list moderators. Moderation is a token of quality for the list. For example, it ensures that subscribers will not receive off-topic messages, unsolicited commercial messages (spams), messages containing large attachments, etc.[%END%]
            </li>
            <li>
                [%|helploc%]In a <strong>non moderated discussion list</strong>, messages are transmitted to all subscribers as soon as the mailing list management robot receives them.[%END%]
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
