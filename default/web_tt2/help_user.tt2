	<h3><a name="howitworks"></a>[%|helploc%]How the mailing list service works[%END%]</h3>
	<p>[%|helploc%]The mailing-list service is managed by a <strong>mailing-list software: Sympa</strong>. This software comes with a <strong>web mailing list environment</strong>.[%END%]</p>
	<p><strong>[%|helploc%]To perform actions related to mailing lists</strong> (subscribe, change your options, etc.), you have two options:[%END%]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>log on to the web environment</strong>;[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc(conf.email,conf.host)%]<strong>send commands by email</strong> to the Sympa mailing list manager at <strong>%1@%2</strong>.[%END%]</li>
	</ul>
	<p>[%|helploc%]<strong>To send a command to Sympa</strong>, do as follows:[%END%]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>If you send a single command</strong>, type it into the subject line of your email and leave its body blank.[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>If you send several commands</strong>, leave the subject line of your email blank and type all the commands in the email body. <strong>Be careful</strong>: Sympa will not process your message unless you respect the following rules:[%END%]
		<ul>
			<li>[%|helploc%]Write every command on a new line.[%END%]</li>
			<li>[%|helploc%]Send your message in plain text, not in <acronym lang="en" xml:lang="en" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> (no formatting).[%END%]</li>
			<li>[%|helploc%]Your message can not contain anything else than Sympa commands (no signature block).[%END%]</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<p>[%|helploc(path_cgi)%]A description of all the commands you can send to Sympa is available at <a href="%1/help/mail_commands">%1/help/mail_commands</a>.[%END%]</p>

	<h3><a name="subscribe"></a>[%|helploc%]Subscribing to mailing lists[%END%]</h3>
	<p>[%|helploc%]Subscribing to a mailing list is very simple:[%END%]</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>[%|helploc%]Choose the address</strong> with which you want to subscribe to the list.[%END%]<br />
			<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]You should choose an address you can check frequently and which offers a large storage capacity for your email: some lists distribute many messages, which sometimes contain large attachments.[%END%]</p>
			<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]Of course you can subscribe to the same list with several email addresses. Then you will need to redo the whole process with a different email address.[%END%]</p></li>
			<li>[%|helploc(conf.email,conf.host)%]Send a <strong>message to %1@%2</strong> from the address you want to subscribe to the list.[%END%]<br />
			<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]Sympa is not a person but a mailing list management robot. Thus it is useless to send it loving words! ;-)[%END%]</p></li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]In the subject line of your message, type in: <strong>subscribe nameofthelist Firstname Name</strong> (replace 'nameofthelist' by the name of the list you want to subscribe to and indicate your own first name and name).[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>Leave the message body blank</strong>.[%END%]<br />
			<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]To save some time, you can also send several commands in a single message. To do that, follow the instructions available in the <a href="#howitworks">How the mailing list service works</a> section.[%END%]</p></li>
	</ol>

	<p>[%|helploc(conf.host)%]<strong>After this, you will receive a message telling you whether your request was accepted or not</strong>: if the subscription to the list is subject to any approval, the list owner may choose not to subscribe you. If so, do not send several other requests: it is useless as the result will remain the same. You can possibly send a message directly to the list owner (nameofthelist-request@%1) to explain why you really want to subscribe to the list...[%END%]</p>
	<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]Note: you will sometimes be asked to confirm your subscription request before it can be processed. If so, please conform to the instructions contained in the message you receive.[%END%]</p>
	<p>[%|helploc%]According to the type of list (list with subscription subject to conditions or not) and to the availability of the list owner, <strong>you may not receive the notice immediately</strong>. It is useless to send several requests.[%END%]</p>
	<p>[%|helploc%]<strong>If your request is accepted, the message you receive confirms your subscription to the list. This message</strong> (the list Charter) <strong>contains several pieces of essential information:</strong>[%END%]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>[%|helploc%]your <strong>list password</strong>. This password is the same for all the lists you subscribed to with a single email address. You can <a href="#global_pref" title="How to change your password">change it online</a> after logging on to the mailing list environment;[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>detailed information about the list</strong>: its purpose, the Internet address at which the message archive is available, etc.[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]the <strong>rules applying to the list and its members</strong>: allowed and forbidden topics, netiquette, legal information, privacy policy, etc.[%END%]</li>
	</ul>
	<p>[%|helploc%]<strong>You should keep your subscription notice</strong>: you may need it later to remember your password or to send a precise command to Sympa (example: signoff command). More generally, <strong>we advise you to keep all your subscription notices to mailing lists</strong>.[%END%]</p>
	<p>[%|helploc%]<strong>You can also subscribe to a list through the mailing list web interface</strong>. To do that, do as follows:[%END%]</p>
	<ol>
		<li>[%|helploc(path_cgi)%]Go to the list environment <strong><a href="%1/home">homepage</a></strong> and <strong>log on</strong>.[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>Go to the information page of the list</strong> you want to subscribe to.[%END%]</li>
		<li>[%|helploc%]In the left menu, <strong>click on the 'Subscribe'</strong> link.[%END%]</li>
	</ol>

	<h3><a name="sympa_auth"></a>[%|helploc%]Logging on to the mailing list environment[%END%]</h3>
	<p>[%|helploc%]To log on to the mailing list environment, use the authentication form displayed on top of the left column of the web interface. When you are logged on, your email address and user profile (subscriber, moderator or owner) are displayed there.[%END%]</p>

	<p>[%|helploc%]The authentication process varies according to your personal situation:[%END%]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>If the organization offering the mailing list service uses single sign-on technology</strong> (unique account and unique authentication, for example through the <acronym lang="en" xml:lang="en" title="Central Authentication Service">CAS</acronym> system), you will preferably log on with your unique account. To do that, click on the 'Go' button next to the text '<strong>Authentication [name of the system used]</strong>'. Then, type in your login and password to log on to the authentication server.[%END%]<br />
		<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]If you have already logged on to another service using the unique authentication system, your authentication is automatic. Refresh page if necessary.[%END%]</p>
		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>If the unique authentication process does not apply to you, you can use your list password.</strong> In this case, log on through the classic method: enter the <strong>email address with which you subscribed to the list</strong> as a login and your <strong>list password</strong> in the 'Password' field.[%END%]</li>
		<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]If you do not remember your list password, click on 'Lost password?'. After you've provided your email address, a mail with a validation URL will be sent at that address.[%END%]</p>

		<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>If the unique authentication process does not apply to you and you do no have a list password yet</strong>, click on '<strong>First login?</strong>' and type in your email address. A confirmation URL will be sent at that address. Then you will be able to choose your password.[%END%]</li>

	</ul>
	<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]Remember: the list password is a special password you will only use for the mailing list service.[%END%]</p>

	<h3>[%|helploc%]Checking your subscriptions[%END%]</h3>
	<p>[%|helploc%]To see all the lists you subscribed to, you need to <a href="#sympa_auth">log on</a> first. Then a list of all your lists, including a short description for each of them, will be displayed in the 'Your lists' form on the left column.[%END%]</p>

	<p>[%|helploc%]<strong>To look at a list information page, click on its name</strong>. The information page includes a description of the list (object, rules applying when sending a message, etc.), which length varies according to the list.[%END%]</p>

The subscribers list displays and shows the <strong>email address</strong> and <strong>name</strong> of each of the subscribers (the indication of the name depends on the subscription method used by the subscribers).[%END%]</p>
	<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]By default, each page displays 25&#160;subscribers. You can browse through the pages by using the browsing arrows or display more subscribers per page. You may also wish to sort subscribers according to their email address, domain or name by clicking on the corresponding column header.[%END%]</p>
	<p>[%|helploc(conf.host)%]<strong>The names of the list owners and moderators are displayed in the left menu</strong>. You should never write directly to a list owner or moderator. If you want to ask a question or make a comment, you should use the following address: <strong>nameofthelist-request@%1</strong> (replace 'nameofthelist' by the name of the list in question).[%END%]</p>
	<p>[%|helploc%]To know <strong>when you subscribed to the list</strong> and <strong>when you last updated your subscriber options</strong>, <strong>click on the 'Subscriber options' link</strong> in the left menu.[%END%]</p>

		<ul>
			<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>digest MIME format</strong>: instead of receiving the list messages in a normal manner, you will get a digest of them on a regular basis.

			<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>text only mode</strong>: this mode allows you to receive only the text version (text/plain) of messages sent in both formats (plain text and <acronym lang="en" xml:lang="en" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>).[%END%]</li>
			<li>[%|helploc%]<strong>HTML only mode</strong>: this mode allows you to receive only the <acronym lang="en" xml:lang="en" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> version (text/html) of messages sent in both formats.[%END%]</li>

		<p class="retraitita">[%|helploc%]A cookie is a small file a web server stores on your hard disk, most generally temporarily, in order to identify you as a user of its service. It contains a few pieces of personal information about you: name, email address, latest logon time, etc.[%END%]</p></li>
