# This file describes which part of a config file may be
# modified or viewed by 
# listmaster, privileged list owners, owners, editors
# Some keys to understand this file :
#
# There is no hierarchical relation between  populations in this
# configuration file. You need to explicitely list populations
#
# listmasters' email addresses are set in sympa.conf 
# owners are listed in each <listname>/config file. When the owner paragraph
# contains the keyword "priviliged" the owner is a "privileged_owner"
#
# this file is set in order to restrict the modification of editor and owners
# to privileged_owner
#
# the family_name parameter must stay in "read"
#
# each line is a set of 3 field
# <Parameter> <Population> <Privilege>
# <Population> : <listmaster|privileged_owner|owner|default> 
# <Privilege> : <write|read|hidden>
# parameter named "default" means any other parameter
