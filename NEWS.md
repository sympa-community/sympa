- Scenarios: `subscribe.*` and `unsubscribe.*` were modified. Now authentication by target user is required when an anonymous/other user requested these actions [\#390](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/390).

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/compare/6.2.33b.2...6.2.34)

**Changes:**

- `cpanfile` to manage depencency modules was introduced [\#355](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/355). `ModDef.pm` was deprecated.
- Directory organization under `static_content` directory was changed [\#220](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/220).
- WWSympa: UI framework was switched to Foundation Sites 6 [\#170](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/170). Appearances of web interface were slightly changed, and several web templates were changed much.
- WWSympa: `wwsympa_url` parameter became optional [\#330](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/330). Conversely, if this parameter was not specified in `robot.conf`, web interface will be disabled for that domain. Existing configuration will be automatically fixed during upgrading process.
- `sympa.conf.bin` and `robot.conf.bin` will no longer be created/updated [\#284](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/284). They were not used anyway. `config.bin` for list config will still be available.
- List parameter `host` was deprecated [\#43](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/43). If you were using it, you should check alias files: See "[Upgrading notes](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade/notes.html)" for details.
- Owners and moderators are no longer stored in list config file: They are stored only in database [\#49](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/49).
    - New pages to configure them were added to web interface [\#275](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/275).
    - New functions `--dump_users` and `--restore_users` to dump and restore users in database were added to `sympa.pl` command line utility [\#232](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/232) [\#267](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/267).
    - List creation templates will not need modification. However, if you were creating lists not using those templates, i.e. creating list directories and necessary files manually, you may also have to create dump files (See "[Dump files](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/customize/basics-list-config.html#dump-files)" for details).

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Introducing cpanfile [\#355](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/355)

See [Upgrading notes](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade/notes.html) for details.
- `css_url` and `css_path` parameters in `robot.conf` are no longer available: Those in `sympa.conf` are used [\#172](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/172). Also see notes above.

## [6.2.17b.1](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/tree/6.2.17b.1) (2017-05-29)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/compare/3a644d4...6.2.17b.1)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Improved on-line help on list configuration edit form [\#15](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/15) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
- \[6.2\] Rewriting code on list configuration form [\#13](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/13) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
- Features in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  - \[12965\] Separate executable upgrade_shared_repository.pl.  Ordinarily, it will be invoked automatically during upgrading process.
  - \[12953\] WWSympa: Function to view messages (held messages, bounces and notifications) works, even if javascript is disabled.  As a result, almost all functions of web interface are available again in the environment without javascript.
  - \[12862\] Adding the template to visualize the lists of lists including the current list.

**Changes:**

- Changes in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  - \[12937\] MICRO-CAL by Amroune Selim has retired.  Instead, jQuery UI Datepicker Widget is introduced.
  - \[12934\] WWSympa: Action URLs no longer may contain e-mail addresses in their path components.  For example:
  `http://host.name/sympa/editsubscriber/list/email%40addr.ess`
  ...is no longer available;
  `http://host.name/sympa/editsubscriber/list?email=email%40addr.ess`
  ...may be used ("%40" is the encoded form of "@").
Because, e-mail addresses can contain slashes ("/") while web servers cannot handle slashes in URL path appropriately: Query parameter would be better to be used.
  - \[12893\] WWSympa: When a name of newly uploaded file in shared document repository is duplicate of exisiting file, uploading will no longer be confirmed.  Instead, a suffix (2), (3), ... will be added to name of the new file.

**Fixed bugs:**

- sympa\_msg.pl crashed with an include\_users\_ldap\_2level [\#12](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/12)
- \[6.2\] Rewriting code on list configuration form [\#13](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/13) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
- \[6.2\] New code for list config semantics [\#9](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/9) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
- riseup fixes to templates [\#4](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/4) ([taggart](https://github.com/taggart))
- Late changes on svn repo [\#2](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/2)
  - \[bug\] wwsympa: Virtual robots in serveradmin/vhosts and rename_list_request pages were not shown correctly.
  - \[bug\] If originator address in message contains upper-case letters, "tag this mail for deletion" in archive won't be shown. Fixed by correcting mhonarc-ressouorces.tt2. Rebuilding is needed to correct past archives.
- \[bug\]\[\#11020\] List admins changes not synchronized with admin\_table [\#1](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/1) ([salaun-urennes1](https://github.com/salaun-urennes1))
- Fixed bugs in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  - \[12972\] \[\#11014\] \[Comitted by M. Deranek\] SQLite: While upgrading Sympa by "sympa.pl --upgrade", upgrading proceduce may fail complaining about non-existent indexes.  Fixed by skipping non-existing indexes and tables to be removed.
  - \[12970\] \[\#11024\] \[Reported by S. Hornburg, LinuXia Systems\] An "obsoleted" list parameter header_list is saved in list config as garbage.  Fixed by removing useless default value.
  - \[12969\] \[\#10969\] \[Reported by M. Perini, Università degli Studi di Perugia\]  In "Listing messages to moderate" page, "Distribute" action fails with error "ERROR (distribute) - Missing argument id|idspam", if it is done in the dialog shown by clicking "View" button.  Fixed by not opening new dialog but transiting confirmation page to choose message topics.
  - \[12968\] \[\#10968\] \[Submitted by S. Hornburg\] Visibility settings in topics.conf were ignored.  Fixed by cheking topics_visibility scenario along with subtopics.
  - \[12966\] \[Reported by A. Meaden, Univ of Kent and submitted by F. Lachapelle, Developpement Strategique Sophos Inc.\] The database log does not record any messages that were successfully delivered to mailing lists.  Fixed by adding an appropriate call to db_log().
  - \[12959\] \[Reported by A. Gouaux\] Exclusion table can not be updated when a user is deleted.  Because family_exclusion column is a primary key in exclusion_table but may not have implicit default.  Fixed by assigning an empty value to such field explicitly.
  - \[12956\] \[Submitted by D. Stoye, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin\] A typo in sympa.wsdl broke SOAP interface.
  - \[12948\] WWSympa: viewbounce & viewmod: If the list name or the email address contains "+", incorrect web links to attachments are generated.
Fixed by encoding special characters in generated links.
  - \[12929\] \[\#10866\] \[Reported by A. Bernstein, Electric Embers\] At least on FreeBSD, init script cannot detect orphaned PID file: Such PIDs are treated as active.  Fixed by checking existence of process more strictly.
  - \[12927\] \[\#6988\] \[Reported by D. Pritts, Internet2\] Using cookie web_archive_spam_protection, user is not redirected to their originally requested page.  Fixed by preserving path info the user initially specified.
  - \[12911\] nginx with systemd: If SCRIPT_FILENAME CGI environment variable is set, wwsympa service will terminate when wwsympa.fcgi is updated.  Fixed by adding "Restart=always" option to unit file.
  - \[12907\] \[Reported by several listmasters\] WWSympa: Link prefetch feature by some browsers may fetch "Unsubscribe" link off the stage so that the users may unsubscribe themselves unconsciously.  "Subscribe" and "Delete" (file) links are alike.
