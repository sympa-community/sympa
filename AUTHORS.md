# Authors

The development of Sympa is a collaborative effort from the users community. However, the following institutions and persons were continuously providing a development effort.

## RENATER

The [RENATER](http://www.renater.fr) team was in charge of maintaining the Sympa project, contribute to the code and merge contributions from developpers all over the world.

Authors of Sympa from RENATER are Étienne Méléard, Olivier Salaün and David Verdin. 

## INRIA

[INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) is the main French public organization for research in the fields of Computer sciences. INRIA contributed on a regular basis on the evolution of Sympa code.

The Sympa author from INRIA is Guillaume Rousse.

## Legacy...

Serge Aumont and Christophe Wolfhugel are, along with Olivier Salaün, the original authors of Sympa. Even though they no longer work on Sympa, they are the people who made Sympa real and are still giving us precious advices about the development orientations.
