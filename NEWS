6.2a.9		July 29, 2011

  Changes:

	[7164] src/lib/confdef.pm:  In the parameters config definition, the
	empty default values were replaced by a mention stating that the
	parameter is optional. That way, it won't be written automatically in
	the config.

6.2a.8		July 28, 2011

  Bug fixes: A problem appeared in fresh installs when some optional parameters were missing.

6.2a.7		July 28, 2011

  Features:

	[7144] src/lib/DBManipulatorDefault.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorPostgres.pm, src/lib/SDM.pm,
	src/lib/Sympa/DatabaseDescription.pm:  Full support of automatic
	database upgrade for PostgreSQL.



  Changes:

	[7142] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/SDM.pm:  When no listmaster is defined
	for a robot, the main server listmasters are the default listmasters.

	[7093] src/lib/confdef.pm, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: [#7689][Submitted by
	S. Ikeda] Several improvments in the sympa_wizard.pl and default
	parameters handling:
	* Duplicated entries in confdef.pm were removed.
	* Parameters definitions were sorted according to Sympa.org site
	documentaion.
	* parameter ``domain'' and ``wwsympa_url'' are allocated values when
	sympa_wzard.pl is run.
	* Some parameters were not found in Sympa 6.2 online documentation:
	* list_check_helo
	* bulk_sleep
	They are now listed at and after ``Tag based spam filtering'' category.
	* Enhancement: sympa_wizard.pl create_configuration() was i18n'ized.
	* Some parameter defaults are differ between confdef.pm and online doc.
	pictures_feature, automatic_list_creation,
	misaddressed_commands_regexp, remove_headers, list_check_suffixes,
	process_bouncers_task, session_table_ttl. 

  Bug fixes:

	[7135] web_tt2/notice.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by J.C.
	granger, INRA] In the "Manage your subscriptions" page, list members
	could unsubscribe from list where unsubscription was closed. Fixed by
	checking authorization scenarios.

	[7132] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by F. Gadin, univ. La
	Rochelle] The code in wwsympa used the - deprecated - way of testing
	hash emptiness. Fixed by removing the "defined" pragma when testing
	whether the has contains a defined value.

	[7131] src/lib/tools.pm:  In some cases, sympa.pl would reach 100% CPU
	while processing a message. Fixed by updating the way the text is
	wrapped when a message is constituted.

	[7124] src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2: [#7055][Submitted by Andras
	Bendzsak] email with RFC5322-incompliant mailbox quoted by MTA such as
	Postfix messes archive browsing.  Backported from trunk.

	[7119] wwsympa/bounced.pl.in:  filehandle was not closed.  Backport
	from trunk.

6.1.6		July 20, 2011

  Bug fixes:

	[7135] web_tt2/notice.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by J.C.
	granger, INRA] In the "Manage your subscriptions" page, list members
	could unsubscribe from list where unsubscription was closed. Fixed by

	Postfix messes archive browsing.  Backported from trunk.

	[7119] wwsympa/bounced.pl.in:  filehandle was not closed.  Backport
	from trunk.

6.1.5		June 06, 2011

  Changes:

	[7014] src/lib/Conf.pm: [#7071]CGI.pm changes environment variable
	names ('-' => '_')
	While using generic_sso, declared environment variable names needs to
	be transformed accordingly

  Bug fixes:

	[7059] wwsympa/SympaSession.pm: [Reported by V. Carpier, AC Réunion
	(but seriously, he was in the CRU before!)] SympaSession.pm caused
	"fetch without execute" errors to be issued into the Apache error logs.
	This was due to a second call to "fetchrow_hashref" after all the lines
	had already been fetched, and the statement handler subsequently
	finished. Fixed by including result fetching into a loop.

	[7055] src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  reported by gauthier Catteau Message-ID may
	be longer than 100 chars and so they may result in a SQL error.

	[7019] src/lib/Scenario.pm: [#7521][Submitted by E. del Rio] Explicit
	incldes in scenarios did not longer work because the rules using them
	did not have an authentification method. Fixed by adding them to the
	scenario list as soon as they are found in the main scenario body.

	[7012] src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Reported by J.C. Vergerolles, univ.
	Bordeaux 2] Some DBD, such as DBD-Oracle, issue croak statements when
	the connexion can't be established. This lead to sympa crashing just
	beacuse the database is unreachable. Fixed putting each database
	connection attempt in an eval block. If the connection fails, Sympa
	retries to connect if asked or simply returns undef after logging.

	[7011] src/lib/Conf.pm: [#7071][reported by I.Krzysztof]While using
	generic_sso, allow other characters for the
	'netid_http_header'parameter (including hyphen).

	[7004] mail_tt2/sendssopasswd.tt2, web_tt2/sso_login.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7070]Login with generic_sso failed when
	'force_email_verify' was enabled
	The problem was due to the user password no more stored in the user DB.
	Usage of password to validate the user email address has been replaced
	with one-time tickets.

	[7003] src/lib/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#5989][submited by
	A.Bendzsak] change_email web feature did not updae the netidmap_table.
	Now it does.

	[7002] wwsympa/wwslib.pm: [#3049][reported by L. Foucher, IUT P.
	Sabatier] CAS authentication failed when Sympa web server was behind an
	HTTP reverse proxy. The URL of the service passed to the CAS server was
	incorrect. Now using get_header_field() that can use
	'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST' env variable if set.

6.2a.6		May 11, 2011

  Features:

	[7073] web_tt2/list_menu.tt2:  Added a hook in the list_menu.tt2 web
	template. This allows you to create a template called
	"additional_list_menu_links.tt2". If the template is present in the
	relevant web_tt2 directory (either list, robot or server), its content
	will be added at the bottom of the list_menu panel.

	[7067] mail_tt2/command_report.tt2,
	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, soap/sympasoap.pm,
	src/etc/edit_list.conf, src/lib/Commands.pm, src/lib/Family.pm,
	src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Upgrade.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm,
	src/sympa.pl.in, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  The maximum number of users
	for a list can now be limited. This number is set using the new
	"max_list_members" list parameter. If set to 0 (default), the number of
	users is not limited. The default value for this list parameter is the
	new sympa.conf parameter "default_max_list_members".

	[7063] src/lib/Log.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, src/task_manager.pl.in,
	web_tt2/stats.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Improved stats display:
	data are agregated for each day and all the available data are diaplyed
	in charts.

	[7046] src/lib/confdef.pm, web_tt2/main.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:
	[#6631][requested by O.Lumineau]Per-robot favicon URL

	[7040] web_tt2/list_panel.tt2: [#7395][A.Bernstein]reorganized and
	enhanced list_panel.tt2

	[7039] src/lib/confdef.pm, web_tt2/edit_config.tt2:
	[#7515][S.Ikeda]i18n-ize Edit robot config page

	[7037] mail_tt2/certif_warning.tt2, mail_tt2/command_report.tt2,
	mail_tt2/global_remind.tt2, mail_tt2/helpfile.tt2,
	mail_tt2/index_archive.tt2, mail_tt2/list_created.tt2,
	mail_tt2/list_rejected.tt2, mail_tt2/list_unknown.tt2,
	mail_tt2/listeditor_notification.tt2,
	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2,
	mail_tt2/listowner_notification.tt2, mail_tt2/lists.tt2,
	mail_tt2/message_report.tt2, mail_tt2/request_auth.tt2,
	mail_tt2/sendpasswd.tt2, mail_tt2/user_notification.tt2,
	mail_tt2/which.tt2, mail_tt2/your_infected_msg.tt2, src/lib/List.pm,
	src/lib/confdef.pm: [#3802][submited by P.Crandall, U.Chicago] SYMPA
	gecos used in service messages is no more hard-coded. New 'email_gecos'
	sympa.conf parameter.

	[7035] src/lib/confdef.pm, src/sympa.pl.in: [#6492]Provide expiration
	of in-memory msgid_table. 2 new sympa.conf parameters :
	msgid_table_cleanup_frequency msgid_table_cleanup_ttl

	[7001] src/etc/auth.conf, src/lib/Conf.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: 
	New 'auth_service_friendly_name' in auth.conf CAS paragraph. This
	allows to set a display name for the CAS server, without the
	constraints that 'auth_service_name' entry has ([\w\-\.]).



  Changes:

	[7060] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  The binary cache for the
	main configs are removed during the upgrade. This way, new default
	values will be applied even on the binary cache.

	[7045] src/etc/script/sympa.in: [#6722][D.Pritts, Internet2]modify init
	script to have all configure variables defined at top of script

	[7027] soap/sympa_soap_server.fcgi.in, src/bulk.pl.in,
	src/etc/script/crypt_passwd.pl.in, src/etc/script/init_comment.pl.in,
	src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorDefault.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorMySQL.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorOracle.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorPostgres.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorSQLite.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorSybase.pm, src/lib/Datasource.pm,
	src/lib/LDAPSource.pm, src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Log.pm,
	src/lib/Makefile.am, src/lib/SDM.pm, src/lib/SQLSource.pm,
	src/lib/SympaDatabaseManager.pm, src/lib/Upgrade.pm, src/lib/tools.pm,
	src/lib/tracking.pm, src/sympa.pl.in, src/task_manager.pl.in,
	wwsympa/Auth.pm, wwsympa/Challenge.pm, wwsympa/SympaSession.pm,
	wwsympa/archived.pl.in, wwsympa/bounced.pl.in, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:
	 Refactoring : All the code related to database and LDAP access was
	refactored. Main changes: 
	- new module SDM.pm : handles all the connection and access to the
	Sympa database. Now querying the Sympa database anywhere in the code
	can be done by calling: '&SDM::do_query($statement, @variables). all
	the connections, errors, statement preparation and executions are
	handled in the SDM module.
	- SQLSource and LDAPSource MUST now be manipulated through instances.
	the usage of class methods have been removed, because, with the
	exception of the Sympa database, all the usages are related to
	non-resident connections, so there is no usage of class instances and
	variables.

	[7022] src/lib/DBManipulatorInformix.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorMySQL.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorOracle.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorPostgres.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorSQLite.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorSybase.pm,
	src/lib/DefaultDBManipulator.pm, src/lib/Makefile.am:  DBManipulator*
	modules now inherit from a generic class called DefaultDBManipulator.
	This class will implement all the required functions in MySQL syntax.
	Therefore, functions in DBManipulator* files will only be needed if the
	corresponding RDBMS has a specific behaviour.

	[7021] src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/Conf.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorInformix.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorMySQL.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorOracle.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorPostgres.pm,
	src/lib/DBManipulatorSQLite.pm, src/lib/DBManipulatorSybase.pm,
	src/lib/Datasource.pm, src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Log.pm,
	src/lib/Makefile.am, src/lib/SQLSource.pm,
	src/lib/SympaDatabaseManager.pm:  Factorizing: creating the
	DBManipulator*.pm modules. These modules contain the code specific to
	each RDBMS Sympa supports. The inherit from the generic class
	DataSource. Anytime Sympa tries to access data in an SQL database, it
	must create a SQLSource object with, in argument, a hash containing the
	connexion parameters. All the database manipulations are subsequently
	done through this generic object, not having to take into account any
	RDBMS specificity.
	Also added the "SympaDatabaseManager.pm" module which is specialized in
	manipulating the Sympa database: upgrade, connexion, version checking,
	etc.

	[7020] src/lib/Archive.pm, src/lib/Commands.pm, src/lib/List.pm,
	src/lib/Message.pm, src/lib/mail.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, src/sympa.pl.in,
	wwsympa/archived.pl.in, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now Message object is
	used from sympa.pl down to mail::sending 

	[7017] src/lib/Makefile.am, src/lib/SympaDatabaseManager.pm,
	src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  All the code realted to database management in
	Upgrade.pm was moved to a new module: SympaDatabaseManager.pm

	[7013] src/lib/Conf.pm: [#7071]CGI.pm changes environment variable
	names ('-' => '_')
	While using generic_sso, declared environment variable names needs to
	be transformed accordingly

	[7007] src/lib/Makefile.am, src/lib/Sympa/Constants.pm.in,
	src/lib/Sympa/DatabaseDescription.pm, src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  The database
	description is moved to a dedicated "DatabaseDescription.pm" module to
	improve code lisibility and orthogonality.

	[7000] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/admin.pm,
	src/lib/confdef.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, wwsympa/Auth.pm,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now the sympa.conf, wwsympa.conf and
	robot.conf are cached in binary form (e.g. sympa.conf.bin). This speeds
	up that startup process. Full refactoring of Conf.pm to better
	distinguish conf/robot loading. First step towards robot-independant
	and on-the-fly config loading, and also wwsympa.cnf and sympa.conf
	merge.

  Bug fixes:

	[7056] src/lib/Sympa/DatabaseDescription.pm:  reported by gauthier
	Catteau Message-ID may be longer than 100 chars and so they may result
	in a SQL error.

	[7054] src/lib/Log.pm, src/lib/Sympa/DatabaseDescription.pm,
	web_tt2/stats.tt2:  That stat_counter_table was never created and the
	agregation query had an error; Consequently, stats were never
	agregated.

	[7047] src/lib/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6609][reported by
	V.Mathieu, univ Nancy2]Now preventing list closure if it is included by
	another list

	[7044] src/lib/List.pm, web_tt2/error.tt2: [#7384][requested by
	A.Bernstein]inclusion should exclude badly formed addresses
	Also fixed a bug in List::get_exclusion() since last SDM module
	development

	[7024] src/bulk.pl.in, src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/Commands.pm,
	src/lib/Message.pm, src/lib/mail.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, src/sympa.pl.in,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Internal changes Message object is used in
	all subroutine from sympa.pl to Bulk::store and used by bulk.pl Message
	submitted from web interface are still written in msg spool, but when
	sympa.pl process them it does not need to send them to himself. Now
	sympa.pl can run on a serveur without MTA ssmime signature of message
	with attachement are not altered now message submitted from web
	interface using authenticated http session are processed by sympa.pl
	with 'md5' authentication level.

	[7015] src/bulk.pl.in:	When using merge feature, the merge was don
	only once, with the first user picked. The message was then sent to all
	users with the first user's data. Fixed by reinitializing the message
	object with the original message at each merge loop.

	[7005] src/lib/Conf.pm: While using generic_sso, allow other characters
	for the 'netid_http_header'parameter (including hyphen).

	[7004] mail_tt2/sendssopasswd.tt2, web_tt2/sso_login.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7070]Login with generic_sso failed when
	'force_email_verify' was enabled
	The problem was due to the user password no more stored in the user DB.
	Usage of password to validate the user email address has been replaced
	with one-time tickets.

	[7003] src/lib/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#5989][submited by
	A.Bendzsak] change_email web feature did not updae the netidmap_table.
	Now it does.

	[7002] wwsympa/wwslib.pm: [#3049][reported by L. Foucher, IUT P.
	Sabatier] CAS authentication failed when Sympa web server was behind an
	HTTP reverse proxy. The URL of the service passed to the CAS server was
	incorrect. Now using get_header_field() that can use
	'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST' env variable if set.

6.2a.5		May 10, 2011

		[Removed due to subversion errors]

6.2a.4		January 26, 2011

  Features:

	[6975] src/etc/script/create_db.Pg, src/lib/Sympa/Constants.pm.in,
	src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  add support of postgresql in automatic upgrade
	process



  Changes:

	[6986] src/lib/List.pm, web_tt2/get_inactive_lists.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Submitted by M. Lievre, Orange] Adding
	detailed informations to the get_inactive_lists page of the web
	interface.

	[6980] src/lib/List.pm: [#7392][Submitteb by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] Some MUA and the web page sending option in Sympa
	use Multipart/related content-type. In this case, the footer was not
	appended to messages.

  Bug fixes:

	[6988] wwsympa/SympaSession.pm, wwsympa/cookielib.pm: [#7423][Reported
	by M. Larchet, univ. Nancy 2] The CGI::Cookie.pm module issues a
	warning when trying to parse an empty cookie. This led to overwhelming
	warning logs in Apache error_log. Fixed by not trying to parse an empty
	cookie and directly return undef, which would have happenned anyway
	because the needed cookie is obviously not here in such a situation.

	[6987] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by M. Larchet, univ. Nancy 2,
	M.Lièvre, Orange and L. Grégoire, ENSEEIHT] Owners trying to access the
	list config edition form, section "Sending/receiving setup" when:
	1- No digest parameter was defined in the config file and
	2- they had only read access to the digest parameter
	were being displayed an empty page. this was due to a faulty population
	of this parameter. Fixed by affecting a "type = enum" value to the
	parameter hash.

	[6984] src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [#7372][Reported by L. Breuil] Upgrading to
	6.1.3 broke Sympa startup when using SQLite, because Sympa tried to use
	the CHANGE query, which is unavailable in SQLite. Short term fixed by
	not trying to change database fields with SQLite. The automatic upgrade
	of database will be completely rewritten with version 6.2.

	[6983] web_tt2/pref.tt2:  pref action must not propose change password
	if logged with sso

	[6982] web_tt2/editsubscriber.tt2: [#7376][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] If you narrowed your browser window or zoomed the
	text size enough that the row of admin tabs had to wrap to a new line,
	the entire contents of the editsubscriber.tt2 page would shift off to
	the right side of the browser. What was left behind under the admin
	tabs was just a blank box. Fixed by enclosing the whole
	editsubscriber.tt2 file content with <div class="block"></div>.

	[6981] src/lib/admin.pm: [#7391][Reported by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] The homepage file was not copied when renaming a
	list.

	[6979] src/lib/Bulk.pm:   Fix parser error where sympa.pl create a lot
	of temporary messages in expl dir. This bug was introduced in revision
	6505 of Bulk.pm

	[6978] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7409]The template in
	user_notification.tt2 for the sigrequest action was missing the $list
	parameter, so the $list.name variable came out blank in the resulting
	message to user. Fixed by adding the parameter to the $tt2_param list.

	[6977] src/lib/List.pm: [#7410][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] In List::send_file(), there were certain times when
	the sender value was getting set to the recipient when it shouldn't be.
	Fixed by checking that the sender field has not been previously set
	before affecting the $who var to ist value.

	[6976] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7411][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] After editing a subscriber's options (do_set()), a
	list owner was returned to the suboptions page by default (if
	previous_action wasn't populated), which porduced an error message if
	the owner happenned to not be subscribed to the list. Fixed by
	redirecting to the list's info page instead.

6.2a.3		January 12, 2011

  Features:

	[6959] src/lib/tools.pm, web_tt2/compose_mail.tt2, web_tt2/error.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwslib.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  It is now possible, when
	sending an HTML newsletter through the web interface, to upload a local
	file from the computer instead of using an URL.

	[6944] src/etc/Makefile.am, src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2,
	src/etc/scenari/tracking.owner, src/etc/scenari/tracking.private,
	src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/mail.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  tracking is
	now controled by a scenario (default is tracking.owner)



  Changes:

	[6956] src/lib/List.pm:  Patch from Adam Bernstein to always set
	Reply-To header

	[6950] src/etc/script/Makefile.am, src/lib/Sympa/Constants.pm.in,
	src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  database structure is described in
	Sympa::Constants. db creation script are produced by an authors only
	script part of the tools involved for new version creation. They should
	not be edited anymore by developpers 

	[6947] src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Upgrade.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm,
	src/lib/tracking.pm, src/task_manager.pl.in:  new entry in notification
	 table for expiration of notification records. retention period is
	controle by a new list parameter (tracking/retention_period) with a
	default in robot;conf : tracking_default_retention_pediod. Job is
	performed by task_manager (purge_tables task)

  Bug fixes:

	[6949] src/lib/List.pm:  fix incorrect multiple footer message 

	[6948] src/etc/script/js/sympa.js:  fix a toggleDivDisplay used in

	a typo in the regular expression.

	[6945] src/lib/tracking.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: 
	tracking::remove_message_by_id don't need file handle as parameter

	[6942] src/lib/Scenario.pm: [#7356][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] a space between two auth methods in scenario (e.g.
	smtp, md5 instead of smtp,md5) caused the second authentication method
	to be ignored. Fixed by changing the regexp responsible of scenraio
	rules extraction.

	[6941] src/lib/List.pm:  In the moderation interface, trying to read an
	attachment led to an error because the context within which the
	attachment is read is no longer viewmod, but modindex. Fixed by
	specifying to mhonarc an attchment url root and a relative basedir.

	[6986] src/lib/List.pm, web_tt2/get_inactive_lists.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Submitted by M. Lievre, Orange] Adding
	detailed informations to the get_inactive_lists page of the web
	interface.

	[6980] src/lib/List.pm: [#7392][Submitteb by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] Some MUA and the web page sending option in Sympa
	use Multipart/related content-type. In this case, the footer was not
	appended to messages.

	[6972] mail_tt2/message_report.tt2, src/sympa.pl.in: [#7420][Submitted
	by A. Bernstein, electricembers.net] When a message is rejected because
	it exceeds the maximum allowed size for a list, the report now provides
	informations regarding the size of the mesage, the maximum allowed size
	for this list and a technical notice regarding attachments.

	[6968] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  On list created through the web
	interface, if the list name contains higher case letters, they are
	lower cased to prevent any later inconsistencies in data describing the
	list. The user is warned about it.

	[6753] src/etc/script/sympa.in: [#6847][Submitted by S. Ikeda] The
	sympa init script now actually waits for the dameon to be stopped (up
	to 20 seconds) prior to issuing a status message (failed or success).

  Bug fixes:

	[6988] wwsympa/SympaSession.pm, wwsympa/cookielib.pm: [#7423][Reported
	by M. Larchet, univ. Nancy 2] The CGI::Cookie.pm module issues a
	warning when trying to parse an empty cookie. This led to overwhelming
	warning logs in Apache error_log. Fixed by not trying to parse an empty
	cookie and directly return undef, which would have happenned anyway
	because the needed cookie is obviously not here in such a situation.

	[6987] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by M. Larchet, univ. Nancy 2,
	M.Lièvre, Orange and L. Grégoire, ENSEEIHT] Owners trying to access the
	list config edition form, section "Sending/receiving setup" when:
	1- No digest parameter was defined in the config file and
	2- they had only read access to the digest parameter
	were being displayed an empty page. this was due to a faulty population
	of this parameter. Fixed by affecting a "type = enum" value to the
	parameter hash.

	[6984] src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [#7372][Reported by L. Breuil] Upgrading to
	6.1.3 broke Sympa startup when using SQLite, because Sympa tried to use
	the CHANGE query, which is unavailable in SQLite. Short term fixed by
	not trying to change database fields with SQLite. The automatic upgrade
	of database will be completely rewritten with version 6.2.

	[6982] web_tt2/editsubscriber.tt2: [#7376][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] If you narrowed your browser window or zoomed the
	text size enough that the row of admin tabs had to wrap to a new line,
	the entire contents of the editsubscriber.tt2 page would shift off to
	the right side of the browser. What was left behind under the admin
	tabs was just a blank box. Fixed by enclosing the whole
	editsubscriber.tt2 file content with <div class="block"></div>.

	[6981] src/lib/admin.pm: [#7391][Reported by A. Bernstein,
	electricemebers.net] The homepage file was not copied when renaming a
	list.

	[6978] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7409]The template in
	user_notification.tt2 for the sigrequest action was missing the $list
	parameter, so the $list.name variable came out blank in the resulting
	message to user. Fixed by adding the parameter to the $tt2_param list.

	[6977] src/lib/List.pm: [#7410][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] In List::send_file(), there were certain times when
	the sender value was getting set to the recipient when it shouldn't be.
	Fixed by checking that the sender field has not been previously set
	before affecting the $who var to ist value.

	[6976] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7411][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] After editing a subscriber's options (do_set()), a
	list owner was returned to the suboptions page by default (if
	previous_action wasn't populated), which porduced an error message if
	the owner happenned to not be subscribed to the list. Fixed by
	redirecting to the list's info page instead.

	[6974] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7412][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers] At the end of do_reviewbouncing(), the $param->{'size'}
	setting was taken from $in{'size'}. ItI should actually be set to
	$size, which is equal to $in{'size'} if it's provided or else defaults
	to the wwsconf setting if not. This created an error under some
	conditions.

	[6973] src/lib/PlainDigest.pm: [#7417][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] Some outdated MUA, like Eudora, use an uncommon
	MIME type called text/enriched, which provides formatting without HTML.
	Such a proprietary formatting is not worth a special develmopment -
	ragarding what is possible with HTML, so we treat it now as text/plain.

	[6971] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7421][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] The message displayed on the web when attempting to
	create a list which already exists was incorrect, due to a call to a
	call to reject_report_web() using the wrong error condition.

	[6970] src/etc/script/create_db.SQLite: [Reported by L. Breuil] Fixing
	two typos in the create_db.SQLite script.

	[6942] src/lib/Scenario.pm: [#7356][Submitted by A. Bernstein,
	electricembers.net] a space between two auth methods in scenario (e.g.
	smtp, md5 instead of smtp,md5) caused the second authentication method
	to be ignored. Fixed by changing the regexp responsible of scenraio
	rules extraction.

	[6765] src/sympa.pl.in: [Reported by J. Arnoux, infomaniak.ch] When a
	message was rejected because its size exceeded the allowed quotas, it
	was forwarded with the rejection report message. It made no sense
	because rejection based on the size is there to prevent the circulation
	of too large files. In addiotion, very large messages caused Sympa to
	hang on the reprot generation, doing nothing without crashing.

	[6763] mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, wwsympa/bounced.pl.in:
	[#6747][Reported by D. Pritts, Internet2] A call to
	send_notify_to_listmaster was done using a non existing error_code.
	Fixed by creating a dedicated error code to be issued when bounce related
	errors occur.

	[6757] src/etc/scenari/spam_status.x-spam-status: [#7076][Reported by
	D. Pritts, Internet2] The default antispam scenario included the
	following regexp test on the X-Spam-Status header: /yes/. this was true
	for any antispam engine using the expression "bayes". fixed by changing
	the regexp to /^\s*yes/.

	[6755] src/lib/List.pm: [#6883][Submitted by S. Ikeda]* Topics tagging
	did not work properly on encoded subject and on message body using
	charset other than US-ASCII or UTF-8.
	* case-ignore match was available only on Latin letters without
	accents.

	[6754] src/lib/Lock.pm: [#7015][Submitted by S. Ikeda] In some
	distributions (RHEL 5 for example) File::temp package conflicts with
	OS-bundled perl. Users need then to install the package manually.
	Errors are then triggers when using NFS. Fixed by calling explcitely
	the "new" sub when creating a File::NFS object.

	[6752] src/lib/mail.pm: [#7003][Submitted by S. Ikeda] Bodies of
	service messages were encoded by list character set, diregarding the
	actual receipient lanquage preferences. Fixed by testing user
	preferences prior to set the message charset.

	[6751] src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Message.pm:
	[#6385][#6396][#7029][Submitted by S. Ikeda] Messages containing a
	subject with illegal charset crashed sympa.pl. Fixed by verifying that
	decoding is possible before doing it and leaving otherwise the subject
	unchanged.

	[6749] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6530][Submitted by S. Ikeda]If you
	chose in WWSympa to have the digest for a list go out only on, say,
	Saturday, it would instead go out on Sunday. There was a mismatch
	somewhere between the days of the week referenced by WWSympa and by
	sympa.pl. Fixed by replacing the call to "localtime" by a call to
	"gmtime". See explanations by A. Berstein in the follwing URL for
	details:
	https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tracker/?group_id=23&atid=167&func=detail&aid=6530

	[6745] src/lib/tools.pm, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: [#7301][Submitted by
	S. Ikeda] sympa.conf and cookies.history contain confidential
	information. Access to them should be restricted. Fixed by making Sympa
	set their access permissions to 740.

6.2a.2		December 07, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	New version to get rid of internationalization catalogues bugs. See
	6.2a.1 below for the actual changes.

6.2a.1		December 07, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	[6931] src/lib/mail.pm:  For some reason, the merge parameter was not
	initialized nor transferred to 'sending' function in the 'sendto' sub.

	[6930] po/Makefile.in.in:  xgettext.pl did not have the right to be
	executed.

	[6923] src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  notification table is now created with an
	autoincrement primary key when running sympa.pl --upgrade . STILL
	database creation script do NOT include it.  

	[6917] src/lib/Upgrade.pm:  Add mysql notification_table description.
	Still not complete because of a autoincrement index.

	[6913] web_tt2/modform.tt2, web_tt2/modindex.tt2:  fix hardcoded
	hostname in ajax URL

	[6912] configure.ac, src/etc/script/js/Makefile.am:  The tinymce
	library was not included in the distribution. Fixed by adding its name
	to the "EXTRA_DIR" variable.

	[6910] src/etc/create_list_templates/private_working_group/config.tt2: 
	Fixed TT2 format bug introduced in revision 6610

	[6908] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Fixed bug while calling Log::db_log(),
	now taking a hash as parameter. 
	Calls to web_db_log() should also be cleaned to remove unrequired
	parameters.

	[6907] src/lib/List.pm: Fixed bug in List::send_msg() : Can't call
	method "get_topic" on an undefined value at /home/sympa/bin/List.pm
	Also added checks to detect errors.
	Removed traces

6.2a.0		December 01, 2010

  Features:

	[6702] src/lib/Message.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, wwsympa/archived.pl.in: 
	When a message is archived or when the archives are rebuilt, the files
	produced by archived have any HTML they contain escaped by
	HTML::StripScript. the original message files are left unchanged.

	[6672] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm:  It is now possible to have
	parameter with multiple values. This allows for example to have as much
	custom_robot_parameter instances as needed.

	[6669] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: 
	You can now define a single custom parameter at the robot level, using
	the new parameter custom_robot_parameter. The format for it is:
	"parame_name ; param_value". See
	https://www.sympa.org/manual_6.1/conf-parameters/part1#custom_robot_parameter
	for details.

	[6651] web_tt2/Makefile.am, web_tt2/ca.tt2, web_tt2/lca.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  It is now possible to create Custom actions
	at the list or robot level. These custom actions allow you to create
	new pages in the Sympa web interface. for now, you can only display
	informations using this method. any post treatment (such as form
	submission) must be handled outside of Sympa. See
	https://www.sympa.org/manual_6.1/customizing#custom_actions for more
	details.

*****	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Tracking feature : a great contrib from
*****	French army DGA Information Superiority (Guillaume Colotte and laurent
*****	Cailleux)
*****	The tracking feature is a way to request DSN or DSN + MDN when sending
*****	a message to each subscribers. In that case, Sympa (bounced.pl) collect
*****	both DSN and MDN and store them in a new table "notification_table".
*****	Them, for each message, the list owner can display which subscribers
*****	has displayed, received or not received the message. This can be used
*****	for some important list where list owner need to collect the proof of
*****	reception or display of each message. This page is accessible via
*****	archive (button "tracking").
*****	This feature is controled by 2 list parameters see "tracking" paragraph
*****	in "edit list config"/bounce .

	[requested by R.Sharshenov] New "reject_mail_from_automates_feature"
	list parameter allows to disable the detection (and rejection) of mails
	from automates. This detection is based on the From header field as
	well as the Auto-Submitted header field. A default behavior can be
	defined in sympa.conf.

	[6523] src/etc/script/js/Makefile.am, web_tt2/javascript.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now all the javascript functions in Sympa are
	gathered in sht "sympa.js" file, that will be accessed through the
	static_content URL. Je javascript.tt2 file only contains javascript
	files import and variable initializations.

	[6522] Makefile.am, configure.ac, src/etc/script/Makefile.am,
	src/etc/script/js, src/etc/script/js/Makefile.am:  Now Sympa is
	distributed with a version of jquery and a few plugins we need. These
	scripts are available in the static_content "js" subdirectory and
	accessed through the static_content.'/js' URL.

	[6521] web_tt2/javascript.tt2, web_tt2/review.tt2: [requested by D.
	Pritts, internet2] Replaced the "quiet" checkbox by an "add quietly"
	button in the review form. this will save users the pain to check the
	checkbox before submitting the form if they want the add to be silent.

*****	one of the following event occurs:
*****	- a message is sent to a list;
*****	- a user subscribed to a list;
*****	- a user unsubscribed from a list;
*****	- a user is added to a list by another user;
*****	- a user is removed from a list by another user;
*****	- a user is removed from a list by the automatic bounce management;
*****	- a file is uploaded to the shared directory;
*****	- a file is deleted from the shared;
*****	- a message to a lsit is rejected in moderation;
*****	- a user logs in to the web interface;
*****	- a user logs out;
*****	- a list is created;
*****	- a list is deleted;
*****	- a list is restored;
*****	- a human user (not a harvester) hit a page.
*****	These data are regularly aggregated by the task_manager, in order to
*****	make them anonymous and to have easily displayable data.
*****	The aggregated data are available to users, owners and listmaster in
*****	their respective interfaces. Only relevant data are presented. They are
*****	disiplayed in graphs to help people see trends and activity peaks.
*****	For now, only the data regarding mail sending are actually presented,
*****	due to development deadline, but the other data will  be added soon.
*****	To be able to diaplsy these graphs, you must enable the static_content
*****	URL. In addition, the stats are accessible through the web interface,
*****	so if you customized your web templates, you must update them to
*****	include the links and template processing.

	dedicated to signal undetected spam. If set, list editor can tag
	message in moderation spool. Then they are piped to this external
	script (see contribs repository to have arf and imap examples).
	In addition the list moderation web interface is renewed, the viewmod
	action is now an ajax feature in the modindex page. javascript is used
	to make display more simple and contextualized.
	Ajax is introduced in wwsympa;fcgi (internal is similar to rss feature.
	grepa ajax and modindex and viewmod action are good example. 

	[6753] src/etc/script/sympa.in: [#6847][Submitted by S. Ikeda] The

	'domain', to avoid the need of two distinct variables.

	[6704] src/lib/confdef.pm: [Submitted by G. Rousse, INRIA] More
	consistency between the description of various configuration
	parameters:
	- initial uppercase
	- no ending dot
	- no initial article
	- emphasis on parameter nature (directory, file or url)
	- consistent syntax for list of available values
	- consistent wording
	Also fixes a few typos.

	[6674] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Restoring use of HTML::Stripscript
	module for XSS protection.

	[6668] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now custom actions can accpet an
	infinite number of parameters. These are stored in an array accessible
	in TT2 through the name "cap".

	[6649] configure.ac: [Submitted by G. Rousse, INRIA] Several
	improvments in configure.ac:
	- changed the minimal version of autoconf to 2.60
	- factorization of the section regarding the FSH/non FSH alternative.

	[6635] configure.ac:  Cancel change with revision 6627. Can't rely on
	configure 2.60, not available for RHE 5.5

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  clean traces

	[6592] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  wwsympa.fcgi opens logs as soon as the

	src/etc/script/js/tinymce/*,
	src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm, web_tt2/javascript.tt2,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  It is now possible to use a WYSIWYG editor in
	the "post" section of the web interface. Three new wwsympa.conf
	parameters handle this feature : 
	- use_html_editor: if set to '1' Sympa will use the HTML editor defined
	by the two other parameters.
	- html_editor_file: the path to the main script used to launch the HTML
	editor. This path is relative to the <static_content>/js directory.
	- html_editor_init: the javascript excerpt that enables and configures
	the WYSIWYG HTML editor. Tiny_mce is now distributed with Sympa. The
	javascript used by sympa are now all located in the "js" subdirectory
	of the static content directory and accessed through the static content
	URL.

	[6480] src/lib/Lock.pm:  Increasing the log level in Lock subfunctions.
	These were polluting the logs when a process was set in debug mode.

	[6433] po/Makefile.in.in:  Improved English translation handling
	retrieved from version 6.0.

  Bug fixes:

	[6833] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  'closed' and 'expired' tickets can be
	used is a preexisting session include the same email as email defined
	in the ticket definition. Now users can reuse a ticket by using back
	browser button without being punished by an "allready used ticket"
	error message.

	[6757] src/etc/scenari/spam_status.x-spam-status: [#7076][Reported by
	D. Pritts, Internet2] The default antispam scenario included the
	following regexp test on the X-Spam-Status header: /yes/. this was true
	for any antispam engine using the expression "bayes". fixed by changing
	the regexp to /^\s*yes/.

	[6756] wwsympa/bounced.pl.in: [#6744][Submitted by D. Pritts,
	Internet2] bounced log message misspelled bounce_path as bounce-path.

	[6755] src/lib/List.pm: [#6883][Submitted by S. Ikeda]* Topics tagging
	did not work properly on encoded subject and on message body using
	charset other than US-ASCII or UTF-8.
	* case-ignore match was available only on Latin letters without
	accents.

	[6754] src/lib/Lock.pm: [#7015][Submitted by S. Ikeda] In some
	distributions (RHEL 5 for example) File::temp package conflicts with
	OS-bundled perl. Users need then to install the package manually.
	Errors are then triggers when using NFS. Fixed by calliong explcitely
	the "new" sub when creating a File::NFS object.

	[6752] src/lib/mail.pm: [#7003][Submitted by S. Ikeda] Bodies of
	service messages were encoded by list character set, diregarding the
	actual receipient lanquage preferences. Fixed by testing user
	preferences prior to set the message charset.

	[6751] src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/Message.pm:
	[#6385][#6396][#7029][Submitted by S. Ikeda] Messages containing a
	subject with illegal charset crashed sympa.pl. Fixed by verifying that
	decoding is possible before doing it and leaving otherwise the subject
	unchanged.

	[6749] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6530][Submitted by S. Ikeda]If you
	chose in WWSympa to have the digest for a list go out only on, say,
	Saturday, it would instead go out on Sunday. There was a mismatch
	somewhere between the days of the week referenced by WWSympa and by
	sympa.pl. Fixed by replacing the call to "localtime" by a call to
	"gmtime". See explanations by A. Berstein in the follwing URL for
	details:

*****	Since revision 6168, when a user logged in using LDAP with an email
*****	address, if this address was returned by the LDAP server, the user was
*****	authentified with this address. Some administrators prefer to force the

	[6733] src/lib/tools.pm:  Fixing a rule problme with Stripscript.

	[6732] src/lib/Message.pm:  Plain text message lost linebreaks in the

	[6723] src/lib/Bulk.pm:  While using "merge_feature on", bulk.pl would
	die if the processed mail's encoding was either not defined or unknown
	to the Encode perl module. The error message in STDERR was: "Unknown
	encoding '' at /home/sympa/bin/Bulk.pm line 283".

	univie.ac.at

	[6719] src/bulk.pl.in:	insert a sleep in fork loop to prevent bulkpid
	file corruption

	[6716] src/bulk.pl.in, src/lib/tools.pm:  prevent bulk exiting because
	of a corupted pid file. More bug fix is needed in this area to prevent

	[6707] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  CAS auth bug, reported by Vincent
	Bonamy

	[6703] po/POTFILES.in: [Submitted by G. Rousse, INRIA]This patch fix
	the list of source files with extractable strings, avoiding an error
	when running 'autoreconf' from svn checkout because generated files
	don't exist at this stage.

	[6701] src/lib/confdef.pm:  The 'custom_robot_parameter' was considered
	mandatory, making Sympa to fail starting when it was not set. Fixed by
	specifying that it is optional.

	[6695] src/lib/List.pm:  Double quotes around field names in "order by"
	SQL clauses caused said order to have no effect. fixed by removing the
	double quotes for all supported RDBMS. It looks like none of them uses
	such a syntax.

	[6684] src/lib/mail.pm:  HTML pages sent through the web interface
	arrived with an empty body. this was due to a bad variable
	intialization in the reformat_message sub in mail.pm. This var is now
	initialized and the problem vanished.

	[6680] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  In some - difficult to precisely
	describe - configurations, sessions could be messed due to an inner
	cache of cookie environement variable, either in Apache of perl. Fixed
	by force-blanking this variable as soon as we affect it to a session.

	[6659] src/etc/script/sympa.in: [Submitted by O. Wild, UC Davis]
	"/etc/init.d/sympa status" was
	reporting that the bulk process had died and left the pidfile behind.
	The
	real issue was that multiple bulk processes were running, and the pid
	file had multiple pids listed in it.

	[6657] src/etc/script/js/Makefile.am: [Reported by S. ikeda] $DESTDIR
	variable was not used when js files were installed.

	[6646] src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/mail.pm:  fix internal error while
	sending encrypted message (reported by Reinhold Nagel)

	[6642] src/lib/mail.pm: [#7019][Submitted by R.Nagel, Fraunhofer] Bug
	introduced in revision 5488 : mail::sendto() gets $rcpt as a ref to an
	array of arrays (ref to an array previously). Symptom: sympa.pl would
	reject S/MIME encrypted emails with error message "List::send_msg,
	could not send message to distribute".
	Fixed mail::sendto() and improved error handling.

	[6641] src/lib/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#7058] change_email
	no more fails if list includes another local list
	Also fixed a bug introduced in revision 6634: incorrect call to
	db_log()

	[6630] src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/PlainDigest.pm, src/lib/tools.pm,
	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in, wwsympa/Challenge.pm, wwsympa/SympaSession.pm:
	[#4452][C.Hastie, S.Ikeda] Issue: handling of different character sets
	in PlainDigest.pm was poor. Messages were assumed to be in ascii,
	iso-8859-1 or a closely related character set, and if they were not all
	characters above \x80 were dumped to provide crude, lossy iso-8859-1
	output.updated PlainDigest.pm which normalises all parts to UTF-8.
	Cleanup from Soji :
	- don't bother trying to find path to lynx unless use_lynx is true 
	- anchor content-type test strings to end of string to avoid picking up
	malformed headers as per bug 3702 
	- local Text::Wrap variables - moved repeated code to get charset into
	sub _getCharset 
	- added use of MIME::Charset to check charset aliases 

	[6627] configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: [#6855][S.Ikeda] Samples were
	installed under / and sympa.pdf was not installed. Added missing docdir
	def in configure.ac + AC_PREREQ(2.60)

	[6626] src/etc/ldap_alias_entry.tt2, src/etc/ldap_alias_manager.conf,
	src/etc/script/ldap_alias_manager.pl.in: [O.Lacroix, CIRIL]Fixed a
	couple of things with ldap_alias_manager :
	- list-owner alias now using return_path_suffix configuration parameter
	- adding postfix parameters for transport

	[6623] configure.ac: [O.Lacroix, CIRIL] ./configure --help was not
	consistant with the directory defaults. Changed the help message for
	the following options : --with-expldir, --with-spooldir,
	--with-scriptdir, --with-modulesdir
	***** piddir default changed from PREFIX/var to /var

	[6622] src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2, web_tt2/css.tt2:  rest of css
	bug correction for "archive message actions block"

	[6621] web_tt2/lists.tt2:  Modification to have list subject visible

	[6620] src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2:	CSS modification, class

	[6618] mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, src/lib/admin.pm:
	[#7053][D.Pritts, Internet2] Listmaster notification for renaming was
	wrong - got "list copied" notification instead.

	[6616] src/lib/confdef.pm: [suggested by O.Lacroix, CIRIL] While sympa
	adds a Sender: SMTP header field, it should remove any existing one
	before to prevent messages with multiple Sender: header fields.
	'Sender' is now part of the default 'remove_headers' parameter.

	[6614] src/lib/Conf.pm:  Previously only default distributed css.tt2
	was used to generate CSS files in static_content/. Now also checking
	customized css.tt2.

	[6611] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6879][reported by A.Koshokin, Intel]
	Fixed the BASE HTML tag. The base previously was the archive directory,
	now setting it to the archive message.

	Prevent duplicate entry error in Bulk::store(). This error occured
	while sending duplicate service messages (same content to the same

	This bug was introduced in revision 5150.

	[6593] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm, wwsympa/wwslib.pm,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  The wwsympa config did not use the parameter
	definition in confdef.pm. Consequently, we needed to define new
	parameters in wwslib.pm whereas the parameters defined in confdef could
	only be used in sympa.conf even if the key "file" had the correct
	value. Fixed by replacing all the hard coded parameters declarations in
	wwslib.pm by a parsing of the data contained in confdef.pm. Also added
	the missing parameters to wwslib.pm.

	[6580] src/lib/Lock.pm:  The debug4 log facility does not exist.
	Replacing its occurences with debug3.

	[6572] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  An extra "\n" appended to the "From:"
	field caused HTML message to be trimmed from their headers and
	consequently treated as plain text. This caused HTML messages to arrive
	as a plain text messages starting by SMTP headers.

	[6569] src/lib/List.pm:  fix verp rate 0 ase where Sympa do not send
	messages to subscriber with bounces 

	[6562] src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: Encoding in body of web composed
	messages was broken. Now require version 1.03 of
	HTML::StripScripts::Parser

	[6560] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Functions rename_list and change_email
	could not be run by a robot listmater. Added missing $robot parameter
	to List::is_listmaster() calls

	[6559] src/lib/LDAPSource.pm, src/lib/Lock.pm, src/lib/mail.pm,

	[6536] src/lib/Datasource.pm, src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/SQLSource.pm,
	src/lib/confdef.pm: [#6853] [reported by A.Stephens, univ Bristol]
	Remote data sources could stall task manager and kill sympa.pl. We have
	added a timeout while running the SQL query (for include_sql_query
	sources). The timeout value can be configured at the list level
	(sql_fetch_timeout) with a sympa.conf default
	(default_sql_fetch_timeout) parameter).

	[6535] src/lib/tools.pm: [#6432] [reported by D.Black, cacert.org]
	S/MIME signature could not be verified while using certificates with

	[6529] src/lib/tools.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [S.Ikeda][#3779]
	Comma in gecos caused invalid From: in Web posting. New
	tools::addrencode() for proper encoding of From: SMTP header field
	according to RFC5322.

	[6528] src/lib/Upgrade.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#4106][reported by
	M.Larchet] Shared documents could not get manipulated. This was due to
	changes in the algorithm of MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() function
	(chars -_+! no more Q-encoded). The problem started with version 1.010
	of MIME::EncWords. The fix consists in a massive renaming of shared
	files (according to new algorithm) during sympa.pl --upgrade.

	[6517] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Quick fix to avoid problems with the
	shared if people update their MIME::Encode module.

	[6516] src/lib/mail.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#3984] [submitted by
	S.Kristoffersen] Restored code to add Auto-Submitted SMTP header field.
	mail::mail_file() does 
	not set this header when 'not_auto_submitted' is set, ie when wwsympa
	sends commands to sympa.pl through the msg/ spool.

	[6510] src/etc/Makefile.am:  The spam_status.x-spam-status scenario was
	never copied during install because it was not specified in the
	Makefile.am.

	[6508] src/lib/List.pm: [#6904][Submitted by T. Berry, NASA] The
	_load_admin_file sub did not ut a lock on the config file before
	opening it. If another process was writing it at the same time, the
	function found the file to be empty, and put the list in error config.
	Fixed by adding a lock an removing it once the config is loaded.

	[6507] src/lib/Lock.pm: [#6513] [Landry Breuil] Fix errors in apache
	error log (Use of uninitialized value in sprintf) when debug is enabled

	[6497] src/lib/Lock.pm:  Invalid log facility for some logs in Lock.pm.
	It looks like we can't go below debug3.

	[6496] src/lib/Bulk.pm: [#6937][#6907][#6915][Reported by S. Dukachev,
	A. Gouaux and A. Michon (in order of apparition)] The query used to
	store packets in the bulk_mailer table did enclose interger values
	between quotes, which is not correct. In addition, it obfuscated the
	problem that the '$merge' parameter was sometimes undefined. This led
	to trying to submit an insert query containg a value '' for an integer
	field. Fixed by suppressing quotes for integer values and ensuring that
	the $merge variable has a value set.

	[6494] web_tt2/Makefile.am: [Reported by P. Evans] The edit_config.tt2
	file was not installed during the "make isntall" because it was nt
	declared in the Makefile.am.

	[6490] src/Makefile.am, src/bouncequeue.c, src/familyqueue.c,
	src/queue.c: [#6912][Submitted by S. Ikeda]When queue, queuebounce or
	queueautomatic parameter was not defined in sympa.conf, queue,
	bouncequeue or familyqueue referred unallocated memory instead of using
	value given by configure.

	[6489] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Previous versions of the Q-encoder
	were not completely faithfull to the Q-encoding spec. It changed , but
	some files in the shared still have the former encoding. Added escaping
	to avoid to say that a file does not exist just because the encoding
	canons changed.

	[6481] src/etc/script/create_db.Oracle, src/etc/script/create_db.Pg,
	src/etc/script/create_db.SQLite, src/etc/script/create_db.Sybase,
	src/etc/script/create_db.mysql: [Reported by A. Michon, IBCP and A.
	Gouaux] In the create_db.* scripts, some of the name of the fields
	related to DKIM were uncorrect, leading bulk.pl to fail starting. These
	names are now correct.

	[6479] src/etc/script/create_db.Pg: [reported by A. Michon, IBCP] A
	typo in create_db.Pg caused the db creation query to fail.

	[6470] src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Reported by O. Germes, univ. Rennes1] The
	upper case "O" in "Oracle" caused the task_manager.pl to be unable to
	synchronize datasources. This is a quick fix that reverts the patch for
	bug [#6603].

	[6465] src/lib/Conf.pm: [submitted by G. rousse, INRIA] Spool
	directories created in Conf.pm didn't have ownership set, meaning they
	belonged to root.root, preventing sympa to create new content therein,
	preventing sympa.pl to start.

	[6463] src/bulk.pl.in: [Reported by S. Bosquin, Ejinov] A bad variable
	name seemed to have appeared just before the version tag, making
	bulk.pl to fail starting. Fixed by giving the right name to this
	variable.

	[6452] src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [#6835][Submitted by S. Hornburg,

	[6431] src/bulk.pl.in:	When a packet was found which corresponded to
	no message in the spool table, then an empty message was sent anyway.
	Should such a case arise again, the packet would be deleted.

	[6430] src/lib/List.pm:  while running sync_include(), remove members
	before adding new ones. This will prevent duplicate entries issues will
	members that were added with an incorrect email address including 8bit

	default port for each DBMS correctly. Patch from Stefan Hornburg 

	[6425] src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/admin.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  SMTP-checking of list may send HELO host name
	with port number. Patch from  Soji IKEDA

	[6420] src/lib/List.pm:  Reverting a part of revision #6227. This lead
	to datasources loosing all their subscribers when using a single
	datasource and the synchronizing failed.

	[6416] src/lib/List.pm:  When calling send_notify_to_owner, the
	'$param' parameter was used as a hash, wihout checking first that it
	was actually a hash. in some cases though, such as in
	set_status_family_closed(), it was a ref to an array. This caused Sympa
	to crach with a "Can't coerce array into a hash" error. Fixed by moving
	the bad line in the hash-specific part of the sub.

	[6415] src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2:	Changed template to prevent the
	regular web_tt2_error mail notices for messages that include a From
	header with double quotes (");
	Now using the mhonarc :J flag to escape any quote. Also replaced ""
	with '' in the TT2 condition.

	[6413] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  reported by Reinhold Nagel solve
	improper loading of certs by user brower. 

6.1.3		November 15, 2010

  Bug fixes:

*****	src/lib/confdef.pm, wwsympa/Auth.pm:  [Reported by N. Matthies] Since
*****	revision 6168, when a user logged in using LDAP with an email address,
*****	if this address was returned by the LDAP server, the user was
*****	authentified with this address. Some administrators prefer to force the
*****	usage of canonical addresses. If you want to let userssubscribers use
*****	the address they used logged in with, set the value of the new
*****	wwsympa.fcgi parameter "ldap_force_canonical_email" to '0'.

	src/lib/List.pm, src/lib/PlainDigest.pm, src/lib/tools.pm,
	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in, wwsympa/Challenge.pm, wwsympa/SympaSession.pm:
	[#4452][C.Hastie, S.Ikeda] Issue: handling of different character sets
	in PlainDigest.pm was poor. Messages were assumed to be in ascii,
	iso-8859-1 or a closely related character set, and if they were not all
	characters above \x80 were dumped to provide crude, lossy iso-8859-1
	output.updated PlainDigest.pm which normalises all parts to UTF-8.
	Cleanup from Soji :
	- don't bother trying to find path to lynx unless use_lynx is true 
	- anchor content-type test strings to end of string to avoid picking up
	malformed headers as per bug 3702 
	- local Text::Wrap variables - moved repeated code to get charset into
	sub _getCharset 
	- added use of MIME::Charset to check charset aliases 

	src/lib/tools.pm: Fixing a rule problme with Stripscript.

	src/lib/Message.pm: Plain text message lost linebreaks in the web archives.
	This was due to the text/plain parts in mesasges were handled by Stripscript.
	Fixed by only handling test/html parts with Stripscripts.

	src/etc/script/create_db.mysql: [Reported by Sungmo Ahn] Fix createdb.mysql.

6.1.2		November 05, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	src/etc/script/create_db.mysql:  Fixe from Bob Wood in create_db script
	for mysql

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  While using "merge_feature on", bulk.pl would die if
	the processed mail's encoding was either not defined or unknown to the
	Encode perl module. The error message in STDERR was: "Unknown encoding
	'' at /home/sympa/bin/Bulk.pm line 283".

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  fix In-reply-to:<> header that make thread
	display in mutt or mozilla eroneous  (reported by Peter Schober 
	univie.ac.at

6.1.1           October 22, 2010

	This version includes a lots news such as DKIM support, autosignoff footer link
	included in lists messages, ...

	Various vulnerability have been solved in 6.1.1 : cross side scripting,
	cross-Site request forgeries, brute force attack, DOS.
	These vulnerabilities were identified with the help of P. Gardenat (Rectorat de Rennes)
	during a security audit on Sympa.

        WE STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU TO UPGRADE ANY PREVIOUS VERSION TO 6.1.1

	The changes and features below are the compilation of the announces made for the
	previous beta releases of Sympa 6.1b.x. Don't bother read them if you followed the
	beta. The bugs specifically fixed in each beta are still referred in these beta 
	version sections below.

	NOTE THAT DKIM FEATURE REQUIRES THAT YOU UPDATE YOUR CUSTOM AUTHORIZATION SCENARIOS (see DKIM bellow)

  Bug fixes:
	
        src/lib/List.pm:  Double quotes around field names in "order by" SQL
        clauses caused said order to have no effect. fixed by removing the
        double quotes for all supported RDBMS. It looks like none of them uses
        such a syntax.

        src/lib/mail.pm:  HTML pages sent through the web interface arrived
        with an empty body. this was due to a bad variable intialization in the
        reformat_message sub in mail.pm. This var is now initialized and the
        problem vanished.

        wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  In some - difficult to precisely describe -
        configurations, sessions could be messed due to an inner cache of
        cookie environement variable, either in Apache of perl. Fixed by
        force-blanking this variable as soon as we affect it to a session.

	CAS authentication bug when multiple httpd parameter are submitted
        (fix by Vincent Bonamy)

	src/lib/LDAPSource.pm: [#6802] [T.Berry, NASA] Remove duplicate code +
	variable declared twice

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6842] [S.Ikeda] /help/editlist does not show
	title of parameters

	src/lib/tools.pm: [#6901][reported by D.Black] tools::smime_decrypt()
	could make sympa.pl process crash. 

	src/lib/tools.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [S.Ikeda][#3779] Comma in
	gecos caused invalid From: in Web posting. New tools::addrencode() for
	proper encoding of From: SMTP header field according to RFC5322.

	src/lib/Upgrade.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#4106][reported by
	M.Larchet] Shared documents could not get manipulated. This was due to
	changes in the algorithm of MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() function
	(chars -_+! no more Q-encoded). The problem started with version 1.010
	of MIME::EncWords. The fix consists in a massive renaming of shared
	files (according to new algorithm) during sympa.pl --upgrade.

	src/lib/mail.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#3984] [submitted by
	S.Kristoffersen] Restored code to add Auto-Submitted SMTP header field.
	mail::mail_file() does 
	not set this header when 'not_auto_submitted' is set, ie when wwsympa
	sends commands to sympa.pl through the msg/ spool.

	src/lib/Lock.pm: [#6513] [Landry Breuil] Fix errors in apache error log
	(Use of uninitialized value in sprintf) when debug is enabled

	configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: [#6855][S.Ikeda] Samples were installed
	under / and sympa.pdf was not installed. Added missing docdir def in
	configure.ac + AC_PREREQ(2.60)

	configure.ac: [O.Lacroix, CIRIL] ./configure --help was not consistant
	with the directory defaults. Changed the help message for the following
	options : --with-expldir, --with-spooldir, --with-scriptdir,
	--with-modulesdir
	***** piddir default changed from PREFIX/var to /var

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6879][reported by A.Koshokin, Intel] Fixed
	the BASE HTML tag. The base previously was the archive directory, now
	setting it to the archive message. 
	Bug description: NAME anchors within HTML archived messages were
	broken.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [#7038][reported by D.Pritts, Internet2] Prevent
	duplicate entry error in Bulk::store(). This error occured while
	sending duplicate service messages (same content to the same user). The
	listmaster is no more notified, but the second instance of the message
	is still not sent; this should be fixed.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  To field was not set while sending the
	sendpasswd service message.
	This bug was introduced in revision 5150.

	src/lib/Lock.pm:  The debug4 log facility does not exist. Replacing its
	occurences with debug3.

	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, src/lib/admin.pm:
	[#7053][D.Pritts, Internet2] Listmaster notification for renaming was
	wrong - got "list copied" notification instead.

	src/lib/Conf.pm:  Previously only default distributed css.tt2 was used
	to generate CSS files in static_content/. Now also checking customized
	css.tt2.

	src/lib/List.pm:  fix verp rate 0 ase where Sympa do not send
	messages to subscriber with bounces 

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: Encoding in body of web composed messages was
	broken. Now require version 1.03 of HTML::StripScripts::Parser

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Functions rename_list and change_email could
	not be run by a robot listmater. Added missing $robot parameter to
	List::is_listmaster() calls

	src/lib/Lock.pm:  Invalid log facility for some logs in Lock.pm. It
	looks like we can't go below debug3.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [#6937][#6907][#6915][Reported by S. Dukachev, A.
	Gouaux and A. Michon (in order of apparition)] The query used to store
	packets in the bulk_mailer table did enclose interger values between
	quotes, which is not correct. In addition, it obfuscated the problem
	that the '$merge' parameter was sometimes undefined. This led to trying
	to submit an insert query containg a value '' for an integer field.
	Fixed by suppressing quotes for integer values and ensuring that the
	$merge variable has a value set.

	web_tt2/Makefile.am: [Reported by P. Evans] The edit_config.tt2 file
	was not installed during the "make install" because it was not declared
	in the Makefile.am.

	src/etc/script/create_db.Oracle, src/etc/script/create_db.Pg,
	src/etc/script/create_db.SQLite, src/etc/script/create_db.Sybase,
	src/etc/script/create_db.mysql:
	[Reported by A. Michon, IBCP and A.Gouaux]
	In the create_db.* scripts, some of the name of the fields
	related to DKIM were uncorrect, leading bulk.pl to fail starting. These
	names are now correct.

	src/etc/script/create_db.Pg: [reported by A. Michon, IBCP] A typo in
	create_db.Pg caused the db creation query to fail.


	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Dan Pritts fix
	https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=6839&group_id=23&atid=167

	src/lib/List.pm:  Reverting a part of revision #6227. This lead to
	datasources loosing all their subscribers when using a single
	datasource and the synchronizing failed.

	src/lib/List.pm:  When calling send_notify_to_owner, the '$param'
	parameter was used as a hash, wihout checking first that it was
	actually a hash. in some cases though, such as in
	set_status_family_closed(), it was a ref to an array. This caused Sympa
	to crach with a "Can't coerce array into a hash" error. Fixed by moving
	the bad line in the hash-specific part of the sub.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  security fix : block login submitted with any
	http method but POST. (security audit vuln #5)

	web_tt2/edit_config.tt2:  missing template for config editor

	src/etc/script/arc2webarc.pl.in:  fix incorrect check of date format
	that block 2010 messages (reported by Omen Wild  (ucdavis.edu)

	src/etc/script/create_db.Sybase:   fix missing conf_table in Sybase
	creation script.

	web_tt2/error.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now shared document can't
	be read or edited unless list is open. This is a security fix

	soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in: Fixed a bug that prevented authentication
	while using authenticateAndRun()

	src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Submùitted by F. Lachapelle, Inverse] If the
	db_type is set to Oracle and db_port is specified in the main
	configuration file, than the port would appear two times in the
	connection string.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [reported by F.Fareneau, univ Valenciennes] shared
	documents/folders names were badly encoded while using Encode >= 2.19.
	The issue was related to a low level subroutine
	(Encode::MIME::Header::_encode_q()) that slightly changed its API
	(expecting unicode instead of bytes parameter). Now using
	MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() instead.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [#6552] [Soji IKEDA] Wwsympa would stall while
	loading session data including metacharacters. Existing code
	(tools::string_2_hash()) would loop on a regular expression match.
	Patch also escapes ``"'' characters.

	src/sympa.pl.in: [Submitted by H. Moa] Some message could cause a
	sympa.pl crash. Fixed by embedding the dangerous part of the code in an
	eval statement.

	src/lib/List.pm:  Users received the same message multiple times. This
	was due to a problem in the VERP provisionning. When filling the array
	containing the users for which VERP will be used, Sympa add to sources
	of users : a certain rate of all the users and all the users that have
	a high bounce rate already. for each reception mode, Sympa provisions
	VERP users this way. the problem was the following: for each reception
	mode, Sympa used the list of users using the default distribution mode
	instead of the list of users using the specific distribution mode
	currently treated. this lead to the addition, to the list of bouncing
	users of each reception mode, the list of users selected to receive the
	message in VERP for normal reception mode instead of the high bouncers
	for this reception mode. fixed by using an aray variable regarding the
	kind of reception mode currently treated.

	src/bulk.pl.in, src/lib/tools.pm:  When parsing a message to merge or
	verifying DKIM signature, a MIME::Parser object was created and the
	message parsed into a MIME::Entity. The output of the parser was not
	set to core, so it used its default: the filesystem. It led to the
	creation of a lots of files in the expl directory, that were never
	removed. Fixed by adding the line :

	src/bulk.pl.in:  bulk.pl exited when it could not remove the packet it
	had juste sent. It now only issue an error messge in the logs.

	mail_tt2/urlized_part.tt2, src/lib/List.pm:  Urlize messages charset
	was nor properly set. Consequently, bulk crashed when trying to merge
	the message. In addition, a faulty var name caused Sympa to try to send
	the originla message instead of the urlized message.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  Messages were tagged multiple times as last.

	mail_tt2/command_report.tt2:  fixed bug introduced in revision 6187.
	Sympa.pl would send empty command reports with a "Failed to parse
	command_report.tt2 : Template::Exception" error in its log file

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Fixed bug introduced in revision 5998. web
	signoff did not recognize authenticated users.

	src/bulk.pl.in:  When merge was not activated, Messages were not
	initialized, leading to empty messages.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  remove usage of fingerprint authentication token 

	web_tt2/compose_mail.tt2:  remove some coin coin style text

	src/lib/List.pm: [#3047][reported by N.Chipaux, Mandriva] Some service
	messages sent by Sympa would use an unappropriate language (did not
	match the user language). This issue happened whenever a message was
	sent to more than one reciepient; the first user's language was used
	for the following ones. Fixed List::send_file() and
	List::send_global_file(): now duplicating the 'context' parameter to
	prevent changes of the original data structure.

	src/lib/confdef.pm:  http_host was not set by default in syma.conf,
	making the sympa wizard to fail starting.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, sympa.spec.in, wwsympa/Auth.pm:
	[Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] When a user logged in, using
	LDAP, by providing an email address, if this email was not the first
	one in the LDAP email attribute, then the uiser was not logged with the
	address she provided but with the default address found in the LDAP
	directory. Now, if an email is provided and the login is successful
	,the user is logged in with the email she provided.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in,
	sympa.spec.in:	Fixed a typo in the sympa_soap_client.pl command line
	tool that prevented the service parameters to be used.

	sympa.spec.in: Can't do $module->require() since we no more require the
	UNIVERSAl::require module. Replaced with eval "require $module".

	Makefile.am: [Submitted by M.Deranek] On a multi core system,
	installdir & installconfig targets can run in parallel. Added a
	dependency between these targets.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/List.pm,

	Added a line break to written PID files.

	configure.ac, doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, sympa.spec.in:  Fix
	typo introduced in recent commit.

	src/lib/Conf.pm: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ.Marburg] Inverted test
	caused the config not to be loaded.

	Makefile.am:  The last install message didn't tell to launch
	sympa_wizzard.pl but sympa.pl.

	src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm:  Now Sympa don't complain about
	optional robot parameters without definition in sympa;conf and
	wwsympa.conf. Sympa now stop because of required robot parameters
	without value (minimum a default).  

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  [reported by N.Matthies] Added notice when

  Features:


*****  DKIM : Sympa now supports DKIM for message diffusion and control.
*****          Incoming messages: Authorization scenarios can now use DKIM. Turning
*****on the dkim_feature configuration parameter will provide a new authentication level
*****to the scenario engine. Scenario evaluation for incoming messages with a valid DKIM
*****signature (but no S/MIME signature) will be evaluated with authentication method dkim.
*****So rules that use authentication method smtp will not match. You will nedd to update
*****your scenarios if you want to use DKIM.
*****
*****          Outgoing messages: You may want to make Sympa sign outgoing messages.
*****Almost every aspects of DKIM signature behavior can be customized via Sympa
*****configuration parameters. Please check the DKIM parameters section for
*****further details. Note that each parameter can also be set for a given
*****virtual robot; and most of them are available as list parameter.
*****
*****Which messages should be signed?
*****In order to configure Sympa for signing outgoing messages, you have to decide which messages Sympa should sign . This should be decided for four kind of messages:
*****     Services messages : these are all messages sent by Sympa itself : welcome messages, answers to mail commands, various notification such as remind message and digest messages;
*****     List messages : messages distributed to list members (where the initial From: header is preserved). These messages will fall is one one the following subcategory:
*****           - authenticated messages (using S/MIME signature, challenge or password);
*****           - received with a valid DKIM signature;
*****           - validated by one of the list editors;
*****           - other messages.
*****
*****Server parameters used with DKIM:
*****    o dkim_feature
*****    o dkim_add_signature_to
*****    o dkim_signature_apply_on
*****    o dkim_private_key_path
*****    o dkim_selector
*****    o dkim_signer_domain
*****    o dkim_signer_identity
*****    o dkim_header_list
*****
*****List parameters used with DKIM:
*****
*****    o dkim_feature
*****    o dkim_signature_apply_on
*****    o dkim_parameters
*****        + private_key_path
*****        + selector
*****        + header_list
*****        + signer_domain
*****        + signer_identity
*****
***** YOU WILL NEED TO ADAPT YOUR SCENARIOS TO USE DKIM.

	[Submitted by J. jourdan] Exclude users. Beware, that this feature is different from the blacklist.
	Exclusion makes sense when a list is based on external data sources, thanks
	to exclusion, a user can unsubscribe (or being removed by list owner) even
	though he should be included via an external data source. Users get into the
	exclusion table, through the standard unsubscribe / delete functions. They get
	off the exclusion table with the standard subscribe / add functions. Adding of
	the table 'exclusion_table'.

	that he subscribes. For a finite length or not. Added a calendar in javascript
	to select a date.

6.0.6		September 20, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [#7038][reported by D.Pritts, Internet2] Prevent
	duplicate entry error in Bulk::store(). This error occured while
	sending duplicate service messages (same content to the same user). The
	listmaster is no more notified, but the second instance of the message
	is still not sent; this should be fixed.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  To field was not set while sending the
	sendpasswd service message.
	This bug was introduced in revision 5150.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  In some - difficult to precisely describe -
	configurations, sessions could be messed due to an inner cache of
	cookie environement variable, either in Apache of perl. Fixed by
	force-blanking this variable as soon as we affect it to a session.

	configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: [#6855][S.Ikeda] Samples were installed
	under / and sympa.pdf was not installed. Added missing docdir def in
	configure.ac + AC_PREREQ(2.60)

	configure.ac: [O.Lacroix, CIRIL] ./configure --help was not consistant
	with the directory defaults. Changed the help message for the following
	options : --with-expldir, --with-spooldir, --with-scriptdir,
	--with-modulesdir
	***** piddir default changed from PREFIX/var to /var

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6879][reported by A.Koshokin, Intel] Fixed
	the BASE HTML tag. The base previously was the archive directory, now
	setting it to the archive message. 
	Bug description: NAME anchors within HTML archived messages were
	broken.

	changes in the algorithm of MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() function
	(chars -_+! no more Q-encoded). The problem started with version 1.010
	of MIME::EncWords. The fix consists in a massive renaming of shared

	(Use of uninitialized value in sprintf) when debug is enabled

	wwsympa/Bounce.pm: [#3881] [Michael Quintero] code to handle Groupwise
	7 bounces

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  An extra "\n" appended to the "From:" field
	caused HTML message to be trimmed from their headers and consequently

	based on the From header field as well as the Auto-S
	ubmitted header field. A default behavior can be defined in sympa.conf.

6.1b.4		June 14, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/Lock.pm:  Invalid log facility for some logs in Lock.pm. It
	looks like we can't go below debug3.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [#6937][#6907][#6915][Reported by S. Dukachev, A.
	Gouaux and A. Michon (in order of apparition)] The query used to store
	packets in the bulk_mailer table did enclose interger values between
	quotes, which is not correct. In addition, it obfuscated the problem
	that the '$merge' parameter was sometimes undefined. This led to trying
	to submit an insert query containg a value '' for an integer field.
	Fixed by suppressing quotes for integer values and ensuring that the
	$merge variable has a value set.

	web_tt2/Makefile.am: [Reported by P. Evans] The edit_config.tt2 file
	was not installed during the "make install" because it was not declared
	in the Makefile.am.

	In the create_db.* scripts, some of the name of the fields
	related to DKIM were uncorrect, leading bulk.pl to fail starting. These
	names are now correct.

	src/etc/script/create_db.Pg: [reported by A. Michon, IBCP] A typo in

6.1b.1		May 26, 2010

  Features:

*****  DKIM : Sympa now supports DKIM for message diffusion and control.
*****          Incoming messages: Authorization scenarios can now use DKIM. Turning
*****on the dkim_feature configuration parameter will provide a new authentication level
*****to the scenario engine. Scenario evaluation for incoming messages with a valid DKIM
*****signature (but no S/MIME signature) will be evaluated with authentication method dkim.
*****So rules that use authentication method smtp will not match. You will nedd to update
*****your scenarios if you want to use DKIM.
*****
*****          Outgoing messages: You may want to make Sympa sign outgoing messages.
*****Almost every aspects of DKIM signature behavior can be customized via Sympa
*****configuration parameters. Please check the DKIM parameters section for
*****further details. Note that each parameter can also be set for a given
*****virtual robot; and most of them are available as list parameter.
*****
*****Which messages should be signed?
*****In order to configure Sympa for signing outgoing messages, you have to decide which messages Sympa should sign . This should be decided for four kind of messages:
*****     Services messages : these are all messages sent by Sympa itself : welcome messages, answers to mail commands, various notification such as remind message and digest messages;
*****     List messages : messages distributed to list members (where the initial From: header is preserved). These messages will fall is one one the following subcategory:
*****           - authenticated messages (using S/MIME signature, challenge or password);
*****           - received with a valid DKIM signature;
*****           - validated by one of the list editors;
*****           - other messages.
*****
*****Server parameters used with DKIM:
*****    o dkim_feature
*****    o dkim_add_signature_to
*****    o dkim_signature_apply_on
*****    o dkim_private_key_path
*****    o dkim_selector
*****    o dkim_signer_domain
*****    o dkim_signer_identity
*****    o dkim_header_list
*****
*****List parameters used with DKIM:
*****
*****    o dkim_feature
*****    o dkim_signature_apply_on
*****    o dkim_parameters
*****        + private_key_path
*****        + selector
*****        + header_list
*****        + signer_domain
*****        + signer_identity
*****
***** YOU WILL NEED TO ADAPT YOUR SCENARIOS TO USE DKIM.

	web_tt2/error.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now shared document can't
	be read or edited unless list is open. This is a security fix

	soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in: Fixed a bug that prevented authentication
	while using authenticateAndRun()

	src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Submùitted by F. Lachapelle, Inverse] If the
	db_type is set to Oracle and db_port is specified in the main
	configuration file, than the port would appear two times in the
	connection string.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [reported by F.Fareneau, univ Valenciennes] shared
	documents/folders names were badly encoded while using Encode >= 2.19.
	The issue was related to a low level subroutine
	(Encode::MIME::Header::_encode_q()) that slightly changed its API
	(expecting unicode instead of bytes parameter). Now using
	MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() instead.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [#6552] [Soji IKEDA] Wwsympa would stall while
	loading session data including metacharacters. Existing code
	(tools::string_2_hash()) would loop on a regular expression match.
	Patch also escapes ``"'' characters.

	src/sympa.pl.in: [Submitted by H. Moa] Some message could cause a
	sympa.pl crash. Fixed by embedding the dangerous part of the code in an
	eval statement.

	src/lib/List.pm:  Users received the same message multiple times. This
	was due to a problem in the VERP provisionning. When filling the array
	containing the users for which VERP will be used, Sympa add to sources
	of users : a certain rate of all the users and all the users that have
	a high bounce rate already. for each reception mode, Sympa provisions
	VERP users this way. the problem was the following: for each reception
	mode, Sympa used the list of users using the default distribution mode
	instead of the list of users using the specific distribution mode
	currently treated. this lead to the addition, to the list of bouncing
	users of each reception mode, the list of users selected to receive the
	message in VERP for normal reception mode instead of the high bouncers
	for this reception mode. fixed by using an aray variable regarding the
	kind of reception mode currently treated.

	src/bulk.pl.in, src/lib/tools.pm:  When parsing a message to merge or
	verifying DKIM signature, a MIME::Parser object was created and the
	message parsed into a MIME::Entity. The output of the parser was not
	set to core, so it used its default: the filesystem. It led to the
	creation of a lots of files in the expl directory, that were never
	removed. Fixed by adding the line :

	src/bulk.pl.in:  bulk.pl exited when it could not remove the packet it
	had juste sent. It now only issue an error messge in the logs.

	mail_tt2/urlized_part.tt2, src/lib/List.pm:  Urlize messages charset
	was nor properly set. Consequently, bulk crashed when trying to merge
	the message. In addition, a faulty var name caused Sympa to try to send
	the originla message instead of the urlized message.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  Messages were tagged multiple times as last.

	mail_tt2/command_report.tt2:  fixed bug introduced in revision 6187.
	Sympa.pl would send empty command reports with a "Failed to parse
	command_report.tt2 : Template::Exception" error in its log file

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Fixed bug introduced in revision 5998. web
	signoff did not recognize authenticated users.

	src/bulk.pl.in:  When merge was not activated, Messages were not
	initialized, leading to empty messages.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  remove usage of fingerprint authentication token 

	web_tt2/compose_mail.tt2:  remove some coin coin style text

	src/lib/List.pm: [#3047][reported by N.Chipaux, Mandriva] Some service
	messages sent by Sympa would use an unappropriate language (did not
	match the user language). This issue happened whenever a message was
	sent to more than one reciepient; the first user's language was used
	for the following ones. Fixed List::send_file() and
	List::send_global_file(): now duplicating the 'context' parameter to
	prevent changes of the original data structure.

	src/lib/confdef.pm:  http_host was not set by default in syma.conf,
	making the sympa wizard to fail starting.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, sympa.spec.in, wwsympa/Auth.pm:
	[Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] When a user logged in, using
	LDAP, by providing an email address, if this email was not the first
	one in the LDAP email attribute, then the uiser was not logged with the
	address she provided but with the default address found in the LDAP
	directory. Now, if an email is provided and the login is successful
	,the user is logged in with the email she provided.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in,
	sympa.spec.in:	Fixed a typo in the sympa_soap_client.pl command line
	tool that prevented the service parameters to be used.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in,
	sympa.spec.in:	Installed MHonArc version was not properly detected

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in,
	sympa.spec.in: Can't do $module->require() since we no more require the
	UNIVERSAl::require module. Replaced with eval "require $module".

	Makefile.am: [Submitted by M.Deranek] On a multi core system,
	installdir & installconfig targets can run in parallel. Added a
	dependency between these targets.

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/List.pm,
	sympa.spec.in:	Missing "use WebAgent" directive since recent
	reorganization of code (revision 5939).

	Makefile.am, doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, src/lib/tools.pm,
	sympa.spec.in: [#6380][Reported by M.Warkus, Philipps-Univ. Marburg]
	Added a line break to written PID files.

	configure.ac, doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, sympa.spec.in:  Fix
	typo introduced in recent commit.

	src/lib/Conf.pm: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ.Marburg] Inverted test
	caused the config not to be loaded.

	Makefile.am:  The last install message didn't tell to launch
	sympa_wizzard.pl but sympa.pl.

	src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm:  Now Sympa don't complain about
	optional robot parameters without definition in sympa;conf and
	wwsympa.conf. Sympa now stop because of required robot parameters
	without value (minimum a default).  

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  [reported by N.Matthies] Added notice when
	user preferences have been updated

	doc/sample/test/web_tt2/welcome.tt2, po/de.po, po-wwsympa/de.po,
	sympa.spec.in, web_tt2/help_listconfig.tt2, web_tt2/help_shared.tt2,
	web_tt2/help_user.tt2: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg]
	Reporting commits 6012 and 6013 from the 6.0 branch: german translation
	and fixed typos in webhelp.

	src/bulk.pl.in:  bulk.pl now uses the "use strict" pragma. Some
	variables were not properly defined.

6.0.3		June 03, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Reported by O. Germes, univ. Rennes1] The upper
	case "O" in "Oracle" caused the task_manager.pl to be unable to
	synchronize datasources. This is a quick fix that reverts the patch for
	bug [#6603].

	src/lib/Conf.pm: [submitted by G. rousse, INRIA] Spool directories
	created in Conf.pm didn't have ownership set, meaning they belonged to
	root.root, preventing sympa to create new content therein, preventing
	sympa.pl to start.

	src/bulk.pl.in: [Reported by S. Bosquin, Ejinov] A bad variable name
	seemed to have appeared just before the version tag, making bulk.pl to
	fail starting. Fixed by giving the right name to this variable.


6.0.2		May 28, 2010

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [Submitted by S. Ikeda] When bulk_max_count was
	increased, some message packets were processed more than once. Fixed to
	check that a packet is really not locked before trying to send it and
	using a prepared statement to quicken lock process.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Dan Pritts fix
	https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=6839&group_id=23&atid=167

	src/bulk.pl.in:  When a packet was found which corresponded to no
	message in the spool table, then an empty message was sent anyway.
	Should such a case arise again, the packet would be deleted.

	src/lib/List.pm:  Reverting a part of revision #6227. This lead to
	datasources loosing all their subscribers when using a single
	datasource and the synchronizing failed.

	src/lib/List.pm:  When calling send_notify_to_owner, the '$param'
	parameter was used as a hash, wihout checking first that it was
	actually a hash. in some cases though, such as in
	set_status_family_closed(), it was a ref to an array. This caused Sympa
	to crach with a "Can't coerce array into a hash" error. Fixed by moving
	the bad line in the hash-specific part of the sub.

	src/lib/List.pm: [Submitted by M. Brethous, Orange FT Group] When a
	file was used as datasource for subscribers inclusion, no test was done
	on the data found in the file. This led to 100% CPU usage when, for
	example, a very large excel file was used instead of a normal text file
	- a likely error when sources are handled by list owners. Fixed by
	cancelling inclusion when no valid email is found in the 50 first non
	empty lines of the source file.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm:  Fix a bug reported by K Clair (riseup) and Thomas
	Berry (nasa) : no purge where done in bulk_spool_table.

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: [Submitted by R. ANDERSSON] With older version
	of DBD::Mysql, bulk.pl happened to die with an "Out of memory!" cry.
	Fixed by increasing the version to the oldest fixing this problem. See
	http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=19453 for more details.

	src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Submitted by T. Berry, NASA] Some SQL statements
	with Sybase failed when the actual backend was Microsoft SQL Server
	2005 sp3. This was due to a double quote in the definition of a
	constant breaking the query. Fixed by replacing double quotes by
	slash-escaped simple quotes.

	src/lib/Log.pm: [Submitted by P. DiCamillo, univ. Brown] Using Oracle
	10, the logs for the list were never displayed in the web interface.
	This was due to Oracle returning 0 to function $sth->rows, before any
	row are fetched. fixed by first trying to fetch rows before counting
	the number of rows.

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: [Reported by M. anderson, riseup.net] changed
	the minimal version of Time::hires to the older which doesn't seem to
	have any problem with the "time()" function.

	po/ar.po, po/bg.po, po/br.po, po/ca.po, po/cs.po, po/de.po, po/el.po,
	po/en_US.po, po/es.po, po/et.po, po/eu.po, po/fi.po, po/fr.po,

	po/zh_CN.po, po/zh_TW.po, web_tt2/home.tt2: [Reported by M. deranek,
	slonko.net] Removed inheritance of a faulty message with the sympa
	email address in it.

	Makefile.am: [Reported by P. Polkinghorne, Brunel univ.] The message
	displayed at the end of the "make install" didn't make it clear that
	the Perl modules checking must be done before any other upgrade or
	setting operation.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Submitted by K. Maneva-Jakimoska, univ.
	Montclair] when a user had set her name, she could not delete it. the
	only was to set it as ' '. fixed by setting it to undef if no value is
	provided by the form.

	wwsympa/Bounce.pm: [Reported by Q. Brown, univ. Simmons] Sympa
	misinterpreted a header added by the puremessage antispam engine when
	no from was present in a bounce file. this lead to huge filenames for
	bad bounces and overwhlmingly large logs.

	src/lib/List.pm: [Submitted by R. Pinson] When a cutsom_subject was
	used AND the user added the tag herself AND The subject was a
	multi-line subject, then only the first line of the subject was kept in
	the final messgage. Fixed by changing the way Wympa catches the
	non-funtional (subject message and "Re:") part of the subject.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Submitted by K. clair, when no user was
	bouncing in a list, trying to access to the bounces review lead to a
	cryptic error : "No page 1". Fixed by checking if there are more than 0
	bounces before issuing an error.

	src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [Reproted by M. Deranek, slonko.net] Upgrade.pm had
	three problems :

	src/lib/Conf.pm: [Reported by J. Bazik, Brown University] When the
	'sendmail_aliases' parameter was set to 'none', a file named 'none' was
	still created in the list_data directory. Fixed by testing the value of
	this parameter before creating the file.

	src/lib/Lock.pm: [Reported by J. Bazik, Brown University] In the
	subroutine Lock::_lock_nfs, if File::NFSLock failed, the else clause
	attempted to close a filehandle that was never set. Fixed by removing
	this closing attempt.

	Makefile.am:  During the make isntall, the Makefile used a line tha
	ttested the existence of the data_structure.version file in the sympa
	subdirectory of etc. If the file did not exist, then it was created.
	Problems:

	configure.ac: [Reported by M. Deranek, slonko.net] While running
	configure, the option "--with-localedir" could be used, but a warning
	was issued, stating that this option was obsolete. But the replacement
	option proposed (--localedir) was invalid. Fixed by deleting this
	warning message and the overall documentation in configure. Same
	problem fixed with the pair "--with-docdir"/"--docdir".

	src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [Submitted by M. Deranek, slonko.net] The upgrade
	process failed with SQLite, because DBD::SQLite >= 1.26_02 returns the
	table names prefixed with "main".

	web_tt2/compose_mail.tt2: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg]When
	accessing the "Compose message" page from an archive by selecting
	"sender", "list" or "both" with the radio buttons, the selected
	destination address appeared next to two buttons: "Send to the list"
	and "Send to me".

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Avoid to print a sybillin message when no
	bounces exist. If nothing exist, just go on and display a page with no
	entries.

	src/lib/SQLSource.pm: [Submitted by F. Lachapelle, Inverse] If the
	db_type is set to Oracle and db_port is specified in the main
	configuration file, than the port would appear two times in the
	connection string. Fixed by removing useless isolated port insertion
	in the connect string, as it is done for any connection in a central place.


	src/lib/tools.pm: [reported by F.Fareneau, univ Valenciennes] shared
	documents/folders names were badly encoded while using Encode >= 2.19.
	The issue was related to a low level subroutine
	(Encode::MIME::Header::_encode_q()) that slightly changed its API
	(expecting unicode instead of bytes parameter). Now using
	MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords() instead.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [#6552] [Soji IKEDA] Wwsympa would stall while
	loading session data including metacharacters. Existing code
	(tools::string_2_hash()) would loop on a regular expression match.
	Patch also escapes ``"'' characters.



  Changes:

	po/Makefile.in.in:  Updated the make rules for i18N to update the
	English catalogue withou loosing customization.


6.0.1		9th December 2009

  Bug fixes:

	[Submitted by Wen Si] "date" is a reserved keywork with Oracle. Fixed by replacing all the occurrences
	of "AS date" by "AS \"date\".

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Submitted by T. Bellempois, ENS Lyon] In case of CAS error, wwsympa.fcgi crashed,
	because it was calling a subroutine in the module CAS, which doesn't exist in Sympa, instead of AuthCAS.


	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:
	[Reported by P. Maes, univ. Louvain] The report sent to the listmaster when a user cloned a list
	said "<newlistname> was cloned as <newlistname>". the old listname was not used.

	src/sympa.pl.in: [Submitted by H. Moa] Some message could cause a sympa.pl crash. Fixed by embedding
	the dangerous part of the code in an eval statement.

	src/etc/script/tpl2tt2.pl.in: [Reported by A. Schieber, AMUE] tt2.pl was still called by tpl2tt2.pl,
	though the former has been renamed to tt2.pm.


	configure.ac: [Submitted by G. rousse, INRIA] Existence of a postfix command was tested in the configure step. failing to find such a command
	caused the configure to stop. As postfix is not mandatory, such a behaviour is a bug. Check command path (both
	for postmap and newaliases) only if explicitely given by user, otherwise it revert to default values.

	configure.ac: [Submitted by G. Rousse, INRIA] Verifies in detail that the newaliases commnd exists and is executable by Sympa.

  Changes:

	po/ po-wwsympa: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Karlsruhe]: All the i18n strings include now diacritics signs, such as semi-column.
	this allows to respect each language's typography rules.

	po/de.po, /po-wwsympa/de.po: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Karlsruhe] Updated german translations.

	po/pl.po: [Submitted by Marcin Woloszyn, Silesian univ. of Poland] Updated polish translation.

6.0		1st October 2009

	The changes and features below are the compilation of the announces made for the
	previous beta releases of Sympa 6.0. Son't bother read them if you followed the
	beta. The bugs specifically fixed in each beta are still referred in these beta 
	version sections below.

  Features:

*****   New bulk.pl daemon installed with Sympa. This daemon is dedicated to mail distribution and 
*****   allows to parallelize this process on a single server as well as on multiple servers.
*****   The main bulk.pl processes will automatically fork new processes, depending on the amount
*****   of messages left in the database. You can control this behavior with the parameters 
*****   bulk_fork_threshold, bulk_max_count,bulk_fork_threshold, see below.
*****
*****   Messages spool used by the bulk.pl daemon is stored in the database, in two tables : 
*****   - bulkspool_table : one entry per message
*****   - bulkmailer_table : subset of receipients for each message 
*****   New associated sympa.conf parameters :
*****   - bulk_fork_threshold : minimum number of packets in database before the bulk forks to increase sending rate
*****   - bulk_max_count : max number of bulks that will run on the same server
*****   - bulk_lazytime : number of seconds a slave bulk will remain running without processing a message before 
*****     it spontaneously dies
*****   - bulk_wait_to_fork : number of seconds a master bulk waits between two packets number checks
*****   - sympa_packet_priority : default priority set to a packet to be sent by the bulk (for future use)
*****   - pidfile_bulk : location of the daemon PID file

*****   [Olivier Lumineau, CRU] Fresh new web CSS for the web interface.
*****   Here is the list of changes in the web interface :
*****   - New css.tt2
*****   - A new Sympa logo :-)
*****   - New navigation menu through list admin menu and server admin menu
*****   - Miscellaneous modifications in templates (list_admin_menu.tt2 not used anymore)
*****   WARNING : if you customize your own templates you may notice some mess in the page layout. 
*****   In such a case compare your templates to the distributed version and report any difference 
*****   to your own files...

*****   Replace storage of password with encryption by md5 fingerprint. This 
*****   make remind password impossible. So now a one time ticket table is created
*****   ticket are  sent by email as an authentication token. Ticket can be used 
*****   for lost password, create account, moderation request . It should be
*****   generalized to all operation that need a email chalenge.
*****
*****   sympa.pl --md5_encode_password change password encoding in the database using md5.So IT IS NOT REVERSIBLE,
*****   so you should save the database (in a safe place to protect password) 
*****
*****   <WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING>
*****
*****   UPGRADING TO SYMPA 6.0 WILL NOT BE REVERSIBLE!
*****   BECAUSE WE DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE WAY THE PASSWORDS ARE STORED, ONCE YOU UPGRADED TO 6.0
*****   YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE THE SYMPA DATABASE WITH A PREVIOUS VERSION AGAIN (UNLESS YOU ERASE ALL PASSWORDS)
*****   SO IF YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU WILL KEEP SYMPA 6.0, 
*****
*****   MAKE SURE YOU SAVED YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING!
*****
*****   MAKE SURE YOU SAVED YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING!
*****
*****   <WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING><WARNING>

      	src/Conf.pm, src/sympa_wizard.pl: Four new languages are now available by default in Sympa:
	  - Bokmal (B. C. Aasgaard)
	  - Polish (L. Zygmanski)
	  - Finn (J.P. Paloposki)
	  - Vietnamese (C. Siddall)
      	Thanks to the translators for their efforts!

     	/po/Makefile: New make command: "clean-po". Updates the PO catalogues but doesn't try to save strings that disappeared 
	in this version.

     	New button to toogle select/unselect all spams in modindex page
	
	New propertie in object message : spam_status .  This feature is used in modindex (listing of message waiting for 
	moderation) to show message tagued as spam.
	4 new parameters :
	- antispam_feature default off
	- antispam_tag_header_name default X-Spam-Status 
	- antispam_tag_header_spam_regexp default ^\s*Yes
	- antispam_tag_header_ham_regexp default ^\s*No

	If you change antispam_feature to value 'on' the other parameters default are compatible with spamassassin defaults.

	src/sympa.pl:  new sympa.pl options in order to recode shared document files and solve charset slag

	src/Conf.pm: Legacy character set support (submitted by S. Ikeda) is now enabled if the 
	'legacy_character_support_feature' sympa.conf parameter is set to on.

	New parameter 'legacy_character_support_feature'. If set to 'on', legacy character support will be enabled, as 
        discussed in https://listes.cru.fr/sympa/arc/sympa-dev/2006-09/msg00029.html and its follow-ups. Any other value 
	or no definition at all disables the functionnality.

 	Now http://server/sympa/<a valid listname> is redirect to http://server/sympa/info/<a valid listname> insteed of 
	"unkown action" error
	
	New database table in order to store robot config parameters that can be edited inline. This feature is used for color 
	edition in sympa admin/skinsedit

	New scenario test : less_than. (Submitted by S. Amrani, gendarmerie nationale). It Allows to compare two values. Is true
        if the first one is less than the second one. Works with strings, too, if you like.
	  
	Now sympa.pl --test_database_message_buffer can be used in order to verify database capacity to store messages spool 
	(dirty output a nicer is needed ;-)

   	New delivery_time list parameter in order to make distribution at a specified time
	
  	Now template of lists created using web interface can use any input from the create_list_request form referenced as 
	[% custom_input.VARNAME %]

    	New parameter 'inclusion_notification_feature'. If its value is set to 'on', subscribers are notified when they are 
	included in a list through an external datasource. 
	We no longer use the visibility to manage this behaviour to avoid confusion for users and an overwhelming number of 
	scenario evaluations.

	New inline color editor (skins section from "sympa admin")

	New [% editor_msg_body %] mail_tt2 variable : When rejecting a message by email reject command, the message body is 
	transmisted to the tt2 parser so it is now possible to print the message body in the notification sent to the original 
	message sender. The tt2 var to use is [%editor_msg_body%]

	The change_email feature has been rewritten as follows:
	- using authenticating URLs to check the new user email (instead of collecting his password)
	- provide an equivalent listmaster feature to change a user's email address
	- check if user is included ; if so, notify the list owner
	- rename list member picture if he changes his member email address

	[Peter Hart] Message moderation : Added a new function for the moderation of messages. On rejection of messages 
	personalised messages can be created 	and saved and used to give more information as to why these messages were 
	refused by the moderator.

	[Peter Hart] New scenario condition verify_netmask. exemple : verify_netmask('1.12.123.00/24') (changes in intanet 
	scenrii are just comment because we don't have access to the local netmask of installation)

	[Roland Hopferwieser] Extended the ldap_alias_manager.pl to use template to create LDAP entries. Also added a 
	simulation mode for debug purpose.

	New sympa;conf parameters to control logging for a specific module.
	Current version provide only logs for scenario . 
	- log_condition is used to controle in which case logs are applied. Both are multivaluated (list of values comma 
	separated). Example: log_module scenario,smtp
	- log_condition ip=127.0.0.1,email=foo@domain
	- log_module is not implemented for most modules. 'log_module smtp'
	  should replace the option sympa.pl -m

	Clone list : a new way to create lists : creation list form allows now to clone a list as a new empty list, all 
	config and customization are copied but not subscribers, archives and shared.

	src/lib/Conf.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: Extended the format of the generic_sso paragraph in auth.conf.
	Added two new parameters :
	  - http_header_list : allows to explicitely list HTTP header fields that should be cached in sympa user_table. 
	  - http_header_value_separator : user attributes may be multi-valued (including the user email address.
	    This parameter defines the values separator ; defualt is ';' (adapted for Shibboleth)

	soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in: add new features to soap client : add,del,subscribe,signoff

  Changes:

*****   [Submitted by G. Rousse, INRIA] A lot of modification brought to the autotools usage in Sympa. 
*****   This is still a work in progress, but should make the life of Sympa packagers quite easier once it is finished.
*****   This work has greatly simplified all Makefiles, turned into Makefile.am
*****   Substitutions in perl modules are now performed at the "make" time, no more during "make install"
*****
*****   HERE IS THE LIST OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS:
*****   - Default sympa configuration files, previously stored in PREFIX/bin/etc/ are now stored in 
*****     PREFIX/share/default/ directory
*****
*****   - Most --with-xxdir configure options are now obsolete, replaced by equivalent standard --xxdir options
*****     Here is the list of concerned options : 
*****      --with-etcdir => --sysconfdir
*****      --with-bindir => --bindir
*****      --with-sbindir => --sbindir
*****      --with-libexecdir => --libexecdir
*****      --with-datadir => --with-defaultdir
*****      --with-libdir => --with-modulesdir
*****      --with-localedir => --localedir
*****      --with-mandir => --mandir
*****      --with-docdir => --docdir
*****      --with-sampledir => now installed with the documentation
*****    
*****   - Most default installation directories have been change to adopt standard FHS-compliant locations
*****     However, the distributed tar.gz still uses most of the previous locations to make upgrade process 
*****     less awkward. If you run "./configure ; make ; make install" with the tar.gz things will install as 
*****     usually. 
*****     If you run autoconf, it will define the set of target directories either the old way
*****     or the FHS way, depending on wether it finds an existing /etc/sympa.conf file.
*****
*****   - Removed obsolete sudo wrappers ; Sympa now includes C wrappers for both wwsympa.fcgi and sympa_soap_server.fcgi
*****     Check the manual <http://www.sympa.org/manual/index> for more informations on that topic

*****   New required library : gettext-devel

*****   New required CPAN modules :
*****   - AuthCAS : replaces the Sympa's CAS.pm own library
*****   - File::Copy::Recursive
*****   - Net::Netmask
*****   - Term::ProgressBar
*****   - Time::HiRes
*****   - MIME::Lite
*****   - MIME::Lite::HTML
*****   - Email::Date::Format

	[Submitted by G.Rousse, INRIA] check_perl_modules.pl now replaced with sympa_wizard.pl --check. All recent changes in 
	check_perl_modules.pl have been reported in sympa_wizard.pl

	When subscribing to a list, the confirmation popup now shows up only if no custom attributes will be used; Otherwise, 
	this would require that the user confirm twice : first in the popup, then in the custom attributes form; Also adapted 
	the text displayed in the submission form to custom attributes. 

	No more require Net::SSLeay perl module. Using LWP::UserAgent instead

	Now, when performing "make update-po", the catalogue file to update is temporarily saved to avoid losing strings from 
	beta version when updating stable version, or vice-versa. Both updated and saved files are then merged.

	If a message is tagued as a spam and if it is to be moderated or rejected, do not send a report information to the 
	message sender even if the scenario did not return 'quiet' directive

	Now message for moderation is not attached in the message sent to the moderator if tagued as spam.

	Now archives by thread or by chronologie is a session attribute (and a user preference). This feature also fix a bug 
	related to the way archives are cached by client. Now page are "static" for robots (as detected by SympaSession) and 
	dynamic for any others.

	Now if antispam_feature is configured, sympa robot will ignore incomming command messages if tagued as spam. By the same 
	way, spam messages for listmaster, list-request and list-editor will be ignored. Such messages are moved in spool bad 
	and message-id is loggued.  

	New structure %required_args defining required parameters, %required_privileges defines required privileges to run 
	actions and new subroutine check_action_parameters() that does the checking. Removed 1200 lines of code in wwsympa.fcgi

	Changes regarding SOAP session management :
		* SOAP session now uses the session DB table
		* session_id can be validated, checked, used in authenticateAndRun()
		* sympa_soap_client.pl has been extended : new --session_id option, new supported service 
		  --service=getUserEmailByCookie

	No more store unknown bounces in OTHER directories. They are now kept in a bad/ subdirectory in the bounce spool.

	When subscribing to a list, the confirmation popup now shows up only if no custom attributes will be used; Otherwise, 
	this would require that the user confirm twice : first in the popup, then in the custom attributes form; Also adapted 
	the text displayed in the submission form to custom attributes.
	
	css modifications for different internet explorer versions compatibilities
	
	Notifications are now sent to users, for remind, add and del commands, only if the visibility is set to true for these 
	users. Notifications can now be sent to users included by external data sources, when they are added or removed from 
	user list.
	
	Recent versions of Oracle do support the AS clause
	
	Web interface:
	- Adding HTML comments in web templates to help users spotting which template is used for customizing purpose.
	- Alphabetical index of lists in lists action.
	- added contextual help links whenever appropriate
	- thread/chronological archive sorting is now a user session preference
	
	Use homogenous terminology for authentication. Also use one-time tickets for web signoff now
	
	[reported by Micah Anderson, Riseup] Micah reported problems with the use of $* instead of /m in the parser.pl module. 
	It was a good oportunity to remove the old parser code that was used by the task_manager only. The task_manager now 
	uses the TT2 parser. It forces us to change the task template format for structured variables : [x->y] should now
	be written [x.y].
	
	[submitted by Peter Langhans, univ Zurich] in create_list form, bring back the form if a parameter is missing

	[proposed by Peter Langhans, univ Zurich] made units for list parameters translatable

	Add "toggle selection" button in list of closed lists

	Now raising an error if alias_manager failed to install new aliases

	[#713] Now notifying new list owners/moderator as they are added to the list configuration.

	[#534] added more informations to the reviewbouncing page (bounce total, first bounce and last bounce date). 
	Now printing "no score" when the bounce score could not be computed

	Show custom attributes as cells in the list members html table. Now it can be copy&paste in openoffice or excel.

	SOAP server : Changes regarding SOAP session management :
	- SOAP session now uses the session DB table
	- session_id can be validated, checked, used in authenticateAndRun()
	- sympa_soap_client.pl has been extended : new --session_id option, new supported service --service=getUserEmailByCookie

	[Reported by L. Gentis, IUFM Lorraine]When updating a config file while the upgrade process, the "email" parameter 
	value of the "update" paragraph was set to 'listmaster'. However, this value was validated against a regexp for emails. 
	this produced an error log, as 'listmaster' is not a valid email address. Fixed by allowing 'listamster' and 'automatic'  
	strings in this regexp. 'automatic will be used to designate updates done by processes instead of users.

	Message moderation : 
	- Now message for moderation is not attached in the message sent to the moderator if tagued as spam.

	src/confdef.pm: define longer period for default values of cleandelay_xx parameters

	src/lib/List.pm, /src/lib/confdef.pm: Now ttl and distribution_ttl list parameters
	take their defaults in default_ttl and default_distribution_ttl sympa.conf parameters.

	po/de.po, po-wwsympa/de.po: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] Updated German translation.

*****	The directory in which all the default configuration files and directories is installed
*****	is now "default", under the root installation directory. In the previous release, it was
*****	share/sympa/default. You should remove this directory now to avoid confusion.

*****	New configure option: '--enable-fhs'. Sympa supports two kinds of files hierarchies. 
*****	The historical one, where by default all is gathered in the Sympa directry, and also the FHS 
*****	recommended hierarchy. Now if the '--enable-fhs' configure option is set, Sympa is installed 
*****	according to the FHS. Otherwise, it is installed using the historical paths.

	sympa.spec.in: [proposed by Jose-Marcio Martins] no more check the OSYTE, check if functions file exists instead.
	
	[Suggested by G.Rousse] removed 'check-macro-version' Makefile target to avoid the "*** warning: gettext
	infrastructure mismatch: using a Makefile.in.in from gettext version 0.17 but the autoconf macros are from
	gettext version @GETTEXT_MACRO_VERSION@" error. The check can be safely removed because very few macros are used

***** [#6190][Submitted by P.Crandall, univ Chicago] custom inputs, set in create_list, are now clearly prefixed
*****  in the create_list_request.tt2 HTML form. Prefix is 'custom_input.'

	src/lib/Makefile.am: AuthCAS module used to be distributed with Sympa. Since Sympa 6,
	it is a standalone CPAN module. The module still has the same name, therefore old installed
	versions of the module need to be removed

	po/de.po: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] Updated German translation.

	src/lib/CAS.pm: Use a standard AuthCAS module instead of CAS.pm

	check_perl_modules.pl, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in:  check_perl_modules.pl now replaced with sympa_wizard.pl --check

	src/lib/Archive.pm, src/lib/Message.pm, src/lib/PlainDigest.pm, src/lib/mail.pm, src/lib/tools.pm, src/sympa_wizard.pl.in,
	 wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: Changes to the cpan installation process :
		 - Mail::Internet and MIME::Lite modules not directly required
		 - fix calls to install_module()
		 - added informations about prerequisites
		 - generalized the 'usage' entry for each module
		 - added an introduction to warn the user about the length/nature of the process

***** configure.ac: default value for localstatedir changes from $prefix/var to /var.
***** This change should make upgrade easier for sympa 5.x and previous

***** The expl directory has been renamed "list_data". This name better reflects the actual directory content.
***** If you are upgrading from a previous version, you SHOULD:
*****    1- rename you "/home/sympa/expl" directory to "/home/sympa/list_data" to reflect this change.
*****    2- set the "home" sympa.conf parameter to "/home/sympa/list_data".

	Makefile.am, NEWS, configure.ac:
	- Improving the last install message to help people know what command is required to have a running Sympa.
	- Restoring usage of list_data instead of expl. Updating the NEWS file to reflect this change.
	- Restoring the localedir definition in non FHS context to avoid i18n directories to be scattered in the root directory.

	src/etc/create_list_templates/discussion_list/comment.tt2, src/etc/create_list_templates/hotline/comment.tt2,
	src/etc/create_list_templates/html-news-letter/comment.tt2,src/etc/create_list_templates/news-letter/comment.tt2,
	src/etc/create_list_templates/private_working_group/comment.tt2, src/etc/create_list_templates/public_web_forum/comment.tt2,
	web_tt2/create_list_request.tt2: 
	[Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] In the list creation form, suppress the display of the files name
	without a comment.tt2. Get also rid of useless <dl/> tags. The whole page is now translatable.

	web_tt2/css.tt2, web_tt2/javascript.tt2, web_tt2/main.tt2, web_tt2/notice.tt2: When notifying a successful
	action in the web interface, the full interface was unusable before a user clicked a validation button.
	Now, the notification doesn't prevent users from clicking other links or button in the interface.
	It is also smaller, though visible.

 Bug fixes:

       Unsorted:
       - When storing subscription requests, Sympa ignored subscription request if an user had already asked for a subscription, 
	 event if the new request was for another list. Fixed by checking the list name before searching previous subscription 
	 requests for the user.
       - [#3953] Lock.pm imports some constants from Fnctl module and used to redefine them. it resulted in warnings while 
	 running wwsympa.fcgi : "Prototype mismatch: sub Lock::LOCK_SH () vs none at /usr/share/sympa/lib/Lock.pm line 38. 
	 Constant subroutine LOCK_SH redefined at /usr/share/sympa/lib/Lock.pm line 38.". Removed duplicate definitions.
       - [#3990][Submitted by A. Berstein, electricembers.net] The quiet option had been deactivated from the "reject" mail 
         command.

	Bounce management :
	- When a bounce file could not be created, nothing was done, so at the next bounced.pl iteration, the faulty
	  report was still present. In such a case, the bounce report is now moved to bad.
	- [reported by H.Rousseau]: bounced.pl would fail to create files in OTHER/ if From contained incorrect chars. The 
	  bounced.pl process would loop on these files.
	  Now such bounce files are moved to the bad/ subdirectory.

	Init.d script:
	- Sympa start and stop script used the "status" command for system whose OSTYPE was 'linux-gnu'. These systems don't 
	  seem to have such a command.
	- Error in the status check for plain gnu-linux stystems.
	- [Submitted by P. Brown, univ.Southern California] init script sympa was broken for Solaris. It used some syntaxes not 
	  supported by this OS' shell language.

	Install process : 
	- [#3898][Submitted by M. Keisler, mitsein.net] Fix: When checking perl version, Sympa was using human readable 
	  version notation (5.8.8 for example) instead of the format returned by $] (5.008008 for example).
	- [#4453][reported by Chris Hastie] Added dependencies for HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::FormatText CPAN modules

        Internationalization :
	- [#3919][reported by M.Denarek] Error "missing locale parameter" would happen whenever a notification is sent to the 
	  listmaster before the current language et set. Now using the default language when set. Also initialized the default 
	  language with 'en'.
	- [submitted by A.de Bignicourt, UREC] : fixed a charset problem with custom attributes

	LDAP:
	- [Reported by F. Perrichon, univ. Lille 2 and C. Zimmer, univ. Nice Sophia Antipolis] LDAP 2 level queries failed as soon 
	  as one of the queries failed during the second passe. Sympa now just issues a warning in the logs, specifying that a 
	  part of the second passe was not successful.
	- [Submitted by O. Menkens, Fraunhofer IAIS] Wrong error handling of LDAP searches caused Sympa to be unable to sychronize 
	  sources. Some attributes in the LDAP search were not correctly passed to the function.

	List configuration :
	- [#3229][#3237][#3518][Reported by T. Berry, NASA and D. Lalot, univ. Aix-Marseille] Lock failed when two processes 
	  were reading the same file, then one of them switched to write mode. It could then modify the file while the other
	  process was reading, leading to uncomplete informations gathered from reading. Fixed by changing behaviour: Now if 
	  a process wants to switch to or from write mode, it first release the file lock at the filesystem level, then tries 
	  to put a new one. this way, switching to write mode is controlled by the filesystem.
	- [#3713][Reported by A. Bernstein, evil-wire.org] Call to functions in the Storage CPAN module could lead to Sympa
	  processes dying because these functions could issue "croak" message. Fixed by enclosing these call into eval{} blocks.
	- [#3596] "spam_protection" list parameter was not used. Just the robot parameter value.
	- The anti-XSS mecanism HTML-escape outgoing parameters before web pages are parsed. This leads to quotes '"' replaced 
	  with &quot; while editing list parameters. This could break SQL queries for example. The fix consists in unescaping 
	  HTML characters in edit_list function.
	- When notifying the listamaster that an owner had changed her/his mail address, the message was croped. Only on affected 
	  list name was displayed instead of the full list. this was due to a bad parameter sending to the tt2 engine and to a bad 
	  syntax in TT2 FOREACH directive.
	- When removing the last data source by manual edition of the config file, the task manager didn't do the last 
	  synchronization needed to remove the last included subscribers. Fixed by checking if a data source still exist after 
	  each synchronization (instead of before).
	- [Reported by V. Mathieu, univ. Nancy 2] When deleting the last data source, the subscribers list was not correctly 
	  updated. Fixed by restoring a faulty test in wwsympa.fcgi.
    	- It was possible to manually remove all the list owners. This is now impossible by taking into account the minimal 
	  cardionality of complex list parameters.

	List creation :
	- create_list notification failed if listname contained uppercased chars
	- When a list was created, Sympa failed to display the liste activation page to listmaster if an info file didn't exist 
	  for this list. Fixed by testing the existence of this file, and, if it isn't found, displaying an informative message 
	  instead.

	Message moderation :
	- [#3790][Reported by R. Tassoni, National Library of Australia and T. Danel] When displaying a message to moderate 
	  in the web interface, if a document was attached to the message, the link to display the message lead to empty
	  documents. This was because we didn't take into account the fact that MHonArc put the file in a subdirectory.
	  Fixed by changing the kind of ergument file passed from scalar to vector.

	MIME : 
	- [#3702][Reported by A. Bernstein, electricembers.net] Some malformed headers caused Sympa to crash by calling a 
	  method on an undefined MIME::Entity::head object. Fixed by testing the definition of this object before calling 
	  the method.

	RDBMS support :
	- [M.Redinger] reported problems with field names upper cased with Oracle. Now forcing lower cased field names.
	- [Submitted by B.C. Aasgaard, Univ. Oslo] Fix several errors int Postgres database definition and usage in Sympa 6.
	- [Reported by M. Jozsef, Budapest University of Technology and Economics] When fetching queries result into a hash, the 
	  case of each key string was unsure, as some RDMS could return higher cased field name, for example. This led to 
	  apparently empty queries result when trying to acces a lower case field value that had been returned with a higher case 
	  name. Fixed by systematically lowercasing the field name when fetching results in a hash.
   	- [Submited by Ryan Fox] Patch to allow informix external data source.
	- [submitted by Peter Langhans, univ Zurich] fixed oracl-related issues ($parameter longer than 100 chars would make 
	  errors and "date" is a reserved keyword with Oracle)

	Security:
	- [reported by T. Retout] SQL injection threat removed by using place holders instead of direct sprint in a query.
  	- [Submitted by N. Bertrand, univ.  Minnesota] Basic logs in debug don't issue the password  unencrypted in the logs for 
	  function Auth::ldap_authentication. This way, this password won't be sent unencrypted to a possible syslog server.
	- [#4439] [#4440] [reported by O.Berger] security vulnerability which use a file in /tmp.
	- [#4430] store temporary files in Sympa's own tmp directory instead of /tmp to prevent symlink attacks

	Shared web documents :
	- [#1809][Reported by P. von der Hagen, univ. Karlsruhe] Files in the shared directory with regexp special characters 
	  could not be renamed. Fixed by using "\Q" escape signal at the beginning of the regexp (s/\Q$strtofind/strtosubst/).
	- [Submitted by H. Moa] When accessing an rss-feed for the shared files of a list upgraded from 5.2b, wwsympa entered a 
	  tight-loop, load went up to 100%, the webfrontend failed making the webserver reply with 500 and a single-processor 
	  system had to be rebooted. The list in question had no shared files. Fixed by checking that we don't use double slashes 
	  in the path to the shared directory.

	S/MIME : 
	- [Submitted by W. Werner, Fraunhofer-Institut SIT] Message signature verification didn't work if user used
	  different certificate for signing and encrypting AND didn't send both in each message, like Kmail does.
	- [Submitted by W. Werner, Fraunhofer-Institut SIT] The path that Sympa used to look for encryption keys had
	  '.enc' instead of a '@enc' in the file name.

	SOAP server:
	- [reported by S. Bilbeau, univ. Rennes 1] For trusted applications, when declaring an application in
	  trusted_applicaitons.conf, if the app name contained a higher case character, the application was not found, because 
	  Sympa compared the app name to its lower-cased version. Fixed by comparing two lower case strings, thus making 
	  the app name completely case insensitive for Sympa.


 	Web archive:
	- Fixing a problem in custom archiver : now the custom archiver MUSt accept two parameters : list and filename. Both 
	  parameters are filled by archived.pl at execution time. wwsympa.conf must contain the absolute path to the custom 
	  archiver script if admins to use this feature.
	- [Reported by F. Guilleux, CRU] Searching for a string containing some special characters provoked various errors. 
	  Fixed by escaping characters at the moment we use the search engine and not just when parising the characters.
	- [Reported by M. Kretchner, INRIA] It was impossible to remove a message from web archvives or to rebuild them. 
	  this was due to a regexp to prevent archived.pl from using dot-starting files added by some Linux distribution
	  (as Gentoo). Fixed by extending the regexp.

	Web authentication :
	- Login banner was shown even though no user_table entry was listed in auth.conf
	- [Reported by M. Gorecka-Wolniewicz, Nicolaus Copernicus univ., Torun] In some cases, CAS logout
	  didn't work, due to a value of "0" trnaformed into an empty string in the session cookie. Fixed by upgrading CGI version.
	- [#3947][Reported by S. costard Univ. Haute Bretagne] In the case of CAS authentication, a CAS ticket was requested 
	  for any request in the web interface. Fixed by ensuring that the user email is attached to the session.
	- Fix web pages in order to give appropriate messages when requesting first password or password renewal. 
	- Fix incorrect password storage when crating a new user (add_user_db did not use password finger print as 
	  update_user_db does)
	- [#4543] When multiple "ldap" entries were defined in the auth.conf file, only the first one was queried.
	  Also fixed a bug with the default scope being "base", now "sub".

	Web interface:
	- [Reported by M.P. Laisne, Rennes Academy] email change through the user preferences in the web interface was our of 
	  order. This was due to a bad initialization of old and new email parameters. Fixed by using values associated to the 
	  ticket.
	- [Reported by A. Stephens, Bristol University] A [% list %] TT2 var was trailing after e return directive in javascript.
	- [Reported by F. Guilleux] the W3C  gives recommendations for the use of GET and POST: 
	  http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html#checklist. Sympa was not fully compliant to these recommendations, 
	  leading for example to possible unwanted list deletion by administrators using prefetching tools. Fixed by replacing 
	  all the threatening GET requests by POST requests.
	- When using the multiple add form, it was difficult to create a list by copy / paste, because a javascript erased any 
	  data in the textarea on click event. Fixed by modifying said javascript.
	- [Submitted by M. Keisler, mitsein.net] Sympa refused to save topics which contained dashes in their name, due to an 
	  excessively selective regexp. Consequently, it was showing lists with such topics as topicsless. Fixed by accepting 
	  dashes in their regexp. Topics can now contain any alphanumeric, plus '-' and '_'. That should be enough for most needs.
	- DB logs : 'logs_expiration_period' sympa.conf parameter was not loaded. As a result DB logs were expired every day.
	  Also added an error message if two virtual hosts use the same URL.

	Web list config edition form : 
	- default value for parameters like owner/visibility are now compliant with the default value defined in %List::pinfo.
	- is the edit_list context, some unedited parameters were shown as edited. This has been fixed.
	
	Web template edition : 
	- [Reported by J.M. Beuken, univ. cat. Louvain] Fix: When copying a template through the web 
	  interface, HTML was not unescaped before writing the file. c onsequently, the file used to reload the page for 
	  template edition had escaped HTML. for critical files such as main.tt2 or title.tt2, this caused the web page diaply 
	  to choke on tt2 parse errors.
	- Copy_template failed when multiple directories had to be created (mail_tt2/ll_CC for example). Now calling mkdir_all() 
	  from tools::mk_parent_dir(). Also fixed a typo regarding authz errors handling


6.0b.4		23 September 2009

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [Reported by M. Waltz, univ. univ. of the Pacific] When the verp value
	was not defined, it resulted in the value used when storing a packet into database to be
	an empty value. PostgreSQL refuses to store an integer with an empty value. Fixed by
	forcing the value of the VERP field to '0' when it is given undefined to the Bulk::store function.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: When a user already connected on the web interface used a
	one time ticket based on another address than the one she was connected with, the
	identity was not changed in the session. It lead to the impossibility to actually
	change its user email address. Now the session email is defined using the email of
	the one time ticket, whatever was previously set in the current session.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by S. Lorenz, univ. Karlsruhe] If an owner or editor
	of a list was registered with one ore more large capitals in her address, the change_email
	function did not change the address for that list. Fixed by lowercasing the addresses.
	when comparing them.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [Submitted by M. Waltz, univ. univ. of the Pacific] The reception_date_bulkmailer
	field's value was set to an integer value when storing a packet, htough it is an integer field.
	This led PostGReSQL to refuse to sotre the packets. Fixed by restricting thi value to its integer part.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] In the mulitple add form, if a a usbscriber address was preceded
	by empty spaces, it was ignored. Fixed by ignoring leading white spaces in that form.

	src/lib/Scenario.pm: [Reported by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] In the "match" scenario condition,
	if the regexp was empty, the condition returuned true. So if the regexp contained a list variable
	that was not set for that list, the condition returned true. Logically, norhing matches an empty
	regexp, so if the rexep is empty (not white space, really empty) then the condition now return false.

	src/etc/Makefile.am: [Reported by M. Walts, univ. of the Pacific][solution by G. Rousse, INRIA] Default scenarios were
	not installed on Solaris 10 x64/x86, because the regular expression used to do it in the Makefile
	used the "+" sign which is not available in POSIX. replaced it by "*" fixed the problem.

	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, src/lib/List.pm: [Reported by P. Maes, univ. Louvain] When using
	several user data sources, if one source failed the whole synchronization aborted. Now Sympa keeps one
	synchronizing all the data sources, and a mail is sent to the listmaster, in which all the sources for
	which an error was encountered are listed. no error is diplayed to the list owner.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [#6438][Reported by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg]When the list homepage of a list
	was empty, displaying the info in lieu of it resulted in displaying a text without any linebreaks, as
	they have no meaning in HTML. fixed by replacing linebreaks with <br/> tags when this happens.

6.0b.3		14 September 2009

  Bug fixes:

	src/lib/tools.pm: [Reported by M.Warkus] remove_dir() subroutine (used to remove web archives of closed lists) did expect
	the path to include a minimum of 4 slashes '/'. This limitation was introduced in revision 2108.
	Removed this limitation.

	src/lib/confdef.pm: http_host was not set by default in syma.conf, making the sympa wizard to fail starting.

	src/lib/tools.pm: [#6380][Reported by M.Warkus, Philipps-Univ. Marburg] Added a line break to written PID files.
	Without the linebreak, the init script failed to check process status on OS without /etc/init.d/functions

	src/lib/Bulk.pm, src/lib/List.pm: [bug] Missing "use WebAgent" directive since recent reorganization of code (revision 5939).
	Error: Sympa.pl would die while running List::_include_users_remote_file() with error
	"Can't locate object method "new" via package "WebAgent" at /home/sympa/bin/List.pm line 7505."

	Makefile.am: [Submitted by M.Deranek] On a multi core system, installdir & installconfig targets can run in parallel.
	Added a dependency between these targets.
	
	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: Can't do $module->require() since we no more require the UNIVERSAl::require module.
	Replaced with eval "require $module". Error message : Can't locate object method "require" via package 
	"XX" at /home/sympa/bin/sympa_wizard.pl line 515

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: Installed MHonArc version was not properly detected

	soap/sympa_soap_client.pl.in: Fixed a typo in the sympa_soap_client.pl
	command line tool that prevented the service parameters to be used.

	wwsympa/Auth.pm: [Submitted by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] When a user logged in, using LDAP,
	by providing an email address, if this email was not the first one in the LDAP email attribute,
	then the uiser was not logged with the address she provided but with the default address found
	in the LDAP directory. Now, if an email is provided and the login is successful ,the user is
	logged in with the email she provided.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: return to the user target page after authentication even if using shibboleth.

	src/lib/Scenario.pm: [Submitted by P. Maes, univ. Louvain] On some servers, the 'is_bcc'
	condition failed event though the message sent was not a BCC. Fixed by moving the code
	setting the BCC state to another place in the module.

	Makefile.am, configure.ac: [Submitted by G. rousse, INRIA]
		- Make sure that directories exist before trying to copy files into them
		- Copy i18n catalogues into standard directories instead of dedicated location
		- Remove modification of $datadir. Replaced by defaultdir redefinition.
		- gives explicit ownership of pid dir to Sympa by adding the "sympa" subdirectory.

	soap/sympasoap.pm: [#6400][Submitted by A. Bendzsak] There was a typo in sympasoap.pm making
	it use authorization.tt2 instead of authorization_reject.tt2.

	src/lib/confdef.pm: [#6425][Reported by S. Rijnhart, milieudefensie.nl] The spool directories
	not often used were automatically deleted because CleanSpool was sometimes called on the spool
	root directory instead of one the actual spools.This was due to the automatic spool being
	initialized as the spool root directory. Therefore, the sympa.pl automatic cleaning was called
	on the root directory and all its too old subdirectories were deleted.
	Fixed by giving its right value to this spool (and to the digest spool too, by the way).


6.0b.2		31 July 2009

 Bug fixes:

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: [Reported by P. Maes, univ. Louvain] Net::Netmask CPAN module
	was not checked by the Sympa wizard, though it is required.

	d_install_shared.tt2, mail_tt2/moderate.tt2, mail_tt2/modindex.tt2,
	mail_tt2/user_notification.tt2, mail_tt2/welcome.tt2, po/fr.pomail_tt2/moderate.tt2:
	[Submitted by P. Maes, univ. Louvain] The one time ticket URL was included in the
	internationalization message. It had no sense, as an URL won't be translated, and any
	change in the layout (such as putting the URL in another line) would break the translation
	key. Fixed by putting the URL out of the i18n string.

	src/etc/script/create_db.mysql: [Submitted by D. Ayre, univ. E. Carr, Vancouver]
	A missing comma in create_db.mysql made the creation script fail with an SQL error.

	src/lib/Conf.pm: [Reported by M. Warkus, univ. Marburg] When using the default robot,
	wwsympa.conf parameters were not taken into account, only the default values set
	in confdef.pm. The value could only be set in sympa.conf. This was due to the load_robots
	function which initialized the config with default values and sympa.conf values and then
	looked for customized values for virtual hosts only. Fixed by replacing default values by
	their equivalent in wwsympa.conf when found.
	
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in: [Reported by Wen Si] Single value and single instance list
	parameters value could not be removed using the web interface. fixed by *not* going
	directly to the next parameter in do_edit_list when such a parameter is found empty.

	src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [Reported by A. Suter, crox.net] "0" character was not allowed in
	md5 encoded passwords. Changed regular expression to allow it.

	src/lib/Sympa/Constants.pm.in: [Reported by N. Matthies] Typo in ARCDIR constant declaration.

	src/task_manager.pl.in: [Reported by N. Matthies] The task manager failed to process the
	eval_bouncers and purge_orphan_bounces tasks because the corresponding functions did not
	return 1. It cause the manager to conclude there had been an error.

	Makefile.am, configure.ac: [Reported by N. Matthies] It looks like some "general_task_models"
	and "task_models" directory still installed in the etc directory. These directory are not used
	anymore. this was due to a command in Makefile.am installing  "non  writable directories".
	These directories were all isntalled in a separate part of the install process, using
	their normal names and location.

	src/lib/Conf.pm, src/lib/confdef.pm: Sympa doesn't complain anymore when an optional parameter
	is missing in robot.conf.

	src/lib/Bulk.pm: [Reported by Wen Si] A query in the Bulk.pm module was using MySQL-specific SQL orders.
	This caused Oracle (and probably Sybase too) to fail to lock packets in database.
	Fixed by splitting the query into a selection followed by an update,
	and by tweeking it on the base of the RDBMS used.

	src/etc/script/create_db.SQLite, src/lib/Upgrade.pm: [Submitted by M. deranek, slonko.net]
	SQLite support was broken in Sympa, due to syntax errors.

	src/etc/script/ldap_alias_manager.pl.in: --modulesdir-- placeholder was badly spelled in
	ldap_alias_manager.pl, cauing it not to be replaced by its real value at install time.

	src/sympa_wizard.pl.in: Removing useless warning when the 'file' parameter is not indicated
	in the confdef.pm parameter definition. This 'file' parameter is used only when we want to 
	write a value by default in the config file. Otherwise default value will be used.


6.0b.1		16 June 2009

	Changes introduced by this version are int the main 6.0 section.

5.4.3		05 May 2008

  Features:

	po/ja.po, po/web_help_ja.po: Introduction of the huge work in progress by Soji Ikeda to update the Japanese translation of the user interface and translate the online help in Japanese.

	po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation.

	 src/Commands.pm: [#3990][Submitted by A. Berstein, electricembers.net] The quiet option has been reactivated for the "reject" mail command.

  Bug fixes:

	wwsympa/archived.pl: [Reported by M. Kretchner, INRIA] It was impossible to remove a message from web archives or rebuild these archives. This was due to a regexp to prevent archived.pl from using dot-starting files added by some Linux distribution (as Gentoo). Fixed by extending the regexp.

	check_perl_modules.pl: [Reported by M. Gorecka-Wolniewicz, Nicolaus Copernicus univ., Torun] In some cases, CAS logout didn't work, due to a value of "0" transformed into an empty string in the session cookie. Fixed by upgrading CGI version.

	src/task_manager.pl, wwsympa/archived.pl, wwsympa/bounced.pl: [#3957][Reported by O. Berger, Telecom & Management SudParis] When launching Sympa daemons (other than sympa.pl) with an unknown option, the daemon was still launched instead of failing to launch.


5.4.2		14 April 2008

  Features:

	po/zh_CN.po: [Submitted by Li Xuejiang, Zhao Yongming, Yahoo!] Simplified Chinese is now fully translated.

  Changes:

	src/List.pm, src/Upgrade.pm: [Reported by L. Gentis, IUFM Lorraine]When updating a config file while the upgrade process, the "email" parameter value of the "update" paragraph was set to 'listmaster'. However, this value was validated against a regexp for emails. this produced an error log, as 'listmaster' is not a valid email address. Fixed by allowing 'listamster' and 'automatic' strings in this regexp. 'automatic will be used to designate updates done by processes instead of users.

  Bug fixes:

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3947][Reported by S. costard Univ. Haute Bretagne] In the case of CAS authentication, a CAS ticket was requested for any request in the web interface. Fixed by ensuring that the user email is attached to the session.

	src/List.pm: [Submitted by W. Werner, Fraunhofer-Institut SIT] The path that Sympa used to look for encryption keys had '.enc' instead of a '@enc' in the file name.

	src/List.pm: [Submitted by W. Werner, Fraunhofer-Institut SIT] Message signature verification didn't work if user used different certificate for signing and encrypting AND didn't send both in each message, like Kmail does.

	src/Upgrade.pm, src/etc/script/create_db.SQLite: [#3915][Submitted by M. Deranek, slonko.net] SQLite support was broken for the session table.
   

5.4.1		01 April 2008

  Bug fixes:

	/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [Reported by J.M. Beuken, univ. cat. Louvain] When copying a template through the web interface, HTML was not unescaped before writing the file. c onsequently, the file used to reload the page for template edition had escaped HTML. for critical files such as main.tt2 or title.tt2, this caused the web page diaply to choke on tt2 parse errors.

  Changes:

	src/Lock.pm: Increasing log levels in low level functions of Lock.pm.

5.4		27 March 2008

   Bug fixes :

 	/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: While processing a subscription request, first check if user is member of the list

 	/wwsympa/bounced.pl: When a bounce file could not be created, nothing was done, so at the next bounced.pl iteration, the faulty report was still present. In such a case, the bounce report is now moved to bad.

 	/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Anybody loading a page from the web archives would presented a HTTP header for the page expiration corresponding to the last time the archive file was modified (this was introduced to limit multiple harvesting of hte same page by web crawlers). The drawback was that, when browsing archives, all the page is not staitc, just the part related to archives. This posed problems for session management. Fixed by testing if a user is a crawler prior to define the expiration header.

 	/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3790][Reported by R. Tassoni, National Library of Australia and T. Danel] When displaying a message to moderate in the web interface, if a document was attached to the message, the link to display the message lead to empty documents. This was because we didn't take into account the fact that MHonArc put the file in a subdirectory. Fixed by changing the kind of ergument file passed from scalar to vector.

	src/etc/scenari/access_web_archive.intranet, src/etc/scenari/review.intranet, src/etc/scenari/visibility.intranet: [#3744] [remote_addr] variable might not be available for a scenario. [env->remote_addr] should be used instead

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#1809][Reported by P. von der Hagen, univ. Karlsruhe] Files in the shared directory with regexp special characters could not be renamed. Fixed by using "\Q" escape signal at the beginning of the regexp (s/\Q$strtofind/strtosubst/).

	src/Lock.pm: [#3229][#3237][#3518][Reported by T. Berry, NASA and D. Lalot, univ. Aix-Marseille] Lock failed when two processes were reading the same file, then one of them switched to write mode. It could then modify the file while the other process was reading, leading to uncomplete informations gathered from reading. Fixed by changing behaviour: Now if a process wants to switch to or from write mode, it first release the file lock at the filesystem level, then tries to put a new one. this way, switching to write mode is controlled by the filesystem.

	wwsympa/SympaSession.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Bug related to session lost when RSS access comes from the same browser as web browser.


	src/PlainDigest.pm: [#3702][Reported by A. Bernstein, electricembers.net] Some malformed headers caused Sympa to crash by calling a method on an undefined MIME::Entity::head object. Fixed by testing the definition of this object before calling the method.

	src/List.pm: [#3713][Reported by A. Bernstein, electricembers.net] Call to functions in the Storage CPAN module could lead to Sympa processes dying because these functions could issue "croak" message. Fixed by enclosing these call into eval{} blocks.

	src/etc/script/create_db.Pg: [Reported by S. Kristoffersen, univ. Oslo] Missing "DROP TABLE session_table;" line in Pg creation script.  Field id_session in table session_table had the type "int4" which was too small for the size of session id. Fixed by changing type to int8.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3479] http://listes.mydomain.fr/sympa/dump/mylist/light returned an error if authentication was required and not satisfied. Now Sympa asks for authentification instead.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3596] "spam_protection" list parameter was not used. Just the robot parameter value.


   Changes:

	src/SQLSource.pm: [M.Redinger] Reported problems with field names upper cased with Oracle. Now forcing lower cased field names.

	src/Commands.pm, src/List.pm, src/report.pm: [#3636] When accepting multiple subscription requests, the list of pending subscription was not updated. This was due to two loops over email addresses one the one hand and over files on the other hand which were embedded in the wrong order, causing only the first file to be parsed. When an authorized subscription request is received, if the sender is subscribed already, the request is rejected.




5.4b.1		31 January 2008


   New features :

	
	[A.de Bignicourt, UREC]: Custom user attributes
	This feature allows the use of per list custom user attributes. Once defined by the list owner, a form will be presented to new list members on the subscription web page. These custom attributes are either optional or mandatory. The list owner will then see the provided user information while taking the subscription decision. Custom attributes can later be viewed from the review page and editsubscriber page. Custom attributes are stored in a dedicated field of the subscriber_table DB table, as XML data.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Anti-XSS protection. Sympa escapes any HTML that is not its generated by its templates. Some exceptions are the homepage file, which is filtered using  the perl module HTML::StripSripts.

	[#3235][requested by T.Berry, NASA] Allow list owners and editors to set a visibility option. If set to 'conceal', the person is not listed in the list panel. This new option also applies to owner_include and editor_include parameters.

	[requested by S.Carmody, Internet2] New 'remove_outgoing_headers' sympa.conf and list parameter. This parameter
	allows to define a list of SMTP header fields that should be removed before
	a message is distributed to list members. Thus it even makes it possible to
	remove the header fields that Sympa sets.
	The existing 'remove_headers' can now be set in a list config file.
	New 'ignore_x_no_archive_header_feature' sympa.conf parameter ; if set to
	'on', x-no-archive SMTP header field is ignored if found in an incoming
	message (sympa will archive the message).

	custom_vars. Users can define custom parameters in lists and use them in scenarios and mail templates.

	User pictures are now showed (if available) in the web archives. Pictures are showed to authenticated users only, to prevent web harvesters to get them.

	Online help is now internationalized. Use [%helploc%] tags anywhere in the code to create strings that will be located in web_help.po catalogue.

	[#3520][Submitted by C. Paul, evil-wire.org] New parameter in sympa.conf: "allow_subscribe_if_pending". Default value is "on". If set to "off", it is forbidden to add subscribers (through wwsympa) to a list whose status is different from "open".

	[#3357][P.Baumgart, British Telecom] LDAP alias manager is now LDAPS enabled and can be configured via a separate configuration file.
	We've also added a new 'alias_manager' sympa.conf parameter that allows to use such alternate mail aliases management scripts.

	Add custom button in main menu by config 
	https://www.sympa.org/wiki/manual/conf-parameters/part1#main_menu_custom_button

	[requested by B.Thale, Motorola] Keep the 'nomenu' attribute from page to page. Note that the nomenu attribute is lost whenever the user hits a button that uses POST. A better implementation would require the nomenu attribute to be attached to the user session.

	Five new languages supported in Sympa:
	Almost complete:
		- Korean: Mark Smith and Kang Tae-Hee (HP)
		- Simplified Chinese: Mark Smith and Xun Yan (HP)
		- Tradional Chinese: Mark Smith (HP)
	Still partial but on good way:
		- Russian: Chernysh
		- Catalan: Jordi Deu-Pons



   Changes :


	Character strings in po files are now sorted following the files they are found in and their order of apparition in the files.

	src/Scenario.pm: Now, in scenari using SMTP header fields, if a message exists, the value of the header is defaulted to an empty strings if it is empty or missing.

***** NOTE 1 :YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION! We definitely disabled the setuid solution to run **wwsympa.fcgi**.
***** If the script you used in your web server configuration was wwsympa.fcgi (to whom you had attributed the "S" bit) you MUST change
***** your Apache configuration so that the script you use becomes wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi instead of wwsympa.fcgi.

***** NOTE 2 :YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR SOAP SERVER CONFIGURATION! We ALSO definitely disabled the setuid solution to run **sympa_soap_server.fcgi**.
***** If the script you used in your web server configuration was sympa_soap_server.fcgi (to whom you had attributed the "S" bit) you MUST change
***** your Apache configuration so that the script you use becomes sympa_soap_server-wrapper.fcgi instead of sympa_soap_server.fcgi.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Now wwsympa switches to maintenance mode if not run under the right user id. It quits the maintenace mode as soon as the user id is the good one.

	web_tt2/review.tt2: The Dump button is now proposed to list owners only

	src/List.pm, src/SQLSource.pm: [#3550] Change: Changed the SQLSource module to keep track of existing DB handler and their status. The new code allows to save connect() if $dbh already exists. It also allows to prevent multiple "DB connectoin" notifications to be sent to the listmaster ; only the first one is sent.

	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, wwsympa/archived.pl, src/tools.pl: [#3388] If archived.pl can't create the list archive directory when archiving the first message, a notification is set to the listmaster, and the message is saved to spool/outgoing/bad.

	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, wwsympa/bounced.pl: When a problem occurs while handling a bounce, the message is saved to a "spool/bounce/bad" directory.

	src/List.pm: [#3219][Charles Paul, evil-wire.org] Optimizations to List::get_list and List::get_which. List::get_lists() calls from List::get_which() now only load lists of interest, ie those that were determined by querying the subscriber_table DB table.

	src/List.pm: [#1174] default_user_options now applies to included list members. Sympa now ignore most user attributes coming from the original data source (date, update_date, reception, visibility). It make sence to adopt this behavior because these data were set in another list's context and should not be inherited in the new list.

	src/Conf.pm, web_tt2/menu.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3537] In web archives, sets a "Last-Modified" HTTP header to prevent frequent web-harvesting.

	[#2989][Reported by J.C. Delepine, univ. Picardie] If "apply" has the value "forced", then a single "reply" button is available, without any choice. The reply is sent to the addresses specified by "value". Otherwise, the user has three choices: reply to sender, to list or to both.

	Web mail composer is now able to send messages to several recipients.

	Genralization of "use strict vars"

	wwsympa/SympaSession.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Reduce SQL queries for sessions. Don't exist if new session abort.
	Also renew the cookie (a random used as session_id) so it make session hijacking much more difficult.
	
	src/List.pm: [#3611][Reported by A. Berstein, electricembers.net] Adds a "Precedence:" field with value "bulk" in addition to the preexisting one with the value "list" to let MS exchange autoresponders ignore mails from Sympa.

	src/Task.pm: [Reported by M. Deranek, slonko.net] task_manager now ignores files whose name starts with a dot in the spool directory. this done to avoid errors in distributions (such as gentoo) which add doted (system) files in the file system.

	src/sympa.pl, src/List.pm: [#3253][Reported by P. Ferrari, riseup.net] When all editors and owners have set their reception mode to "nomail", a message is sent to all of them instead of generating an internal server error and sendinf a message to listmaster.

src/Commands.pm, src/List.pm, src/Scenario.pm, src/sympa.pl, src/tools.pl: [#3662][Submitted by J. Kirkland, westover.org] Message headers can now be used by any scenario. Admin can use, for example, match([msg_header-><HeaderName>],/someregexp/)       smtp      -> do_it in a scenario, for any message header.

	web_tt2/add_request.tt2: multiple_add : a JS to clear textarea on click

	src/List.pm: [Reported by C. desmoulins and J. Beretta, Orange] During an LDAP include, we didn't check if an email address was present several times, leading to a database field "include_sources_subscriber" containing the LDAP source id as many times as the address had been found. Fixed by preventing an address to be taken into account if it has been met already in the LDAP query result set.



   Bug fixes :


	src/Log.pm: Sympa no longer crashes when logs are not available.

	src/List.pm, /src/admin.pm: When a new Lock object is created, we didn't check that the object tcreation had succeeded. On one occasion, it made task-manager to crash. Now, if the object isn't defined after the "new"
invocation, the functions return undef.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3363][Reported by M. Deranek, slonko.net] The HTML document date was set to 1 jan 1970 instead of current date, causing some browser to be unable to unlog because they seem to compare cookie date to document date for expiration purpose.

	src/SQLSource.pm, /src/Upgrade.pm:[#3305][#3136][#3319] [Reported by G. Haverkamp and M. Deranek] Support of SQLite was broken.

	src/List.pm: [#3298][Reported by A. Ma and S. Ikeda] Fix: Sympa would add a "Re:" to each reply, leading to possibly very long chains of "Re:" in messages subjects.

	src/List.pm: [#3182][Reported by G. Bouteille, univ. Rennes 1 and J.H. Belpois, univ. Brest] Fix: When instantiating a family with list containing an include_sql_query paragraph, new parameters appeared in the paragraph (db_user, db_host, db_psswd). This was because we used to pass a ref to the hash containing list config values to functions which added values to this hash. We now pass a copy of this hash, temporary values are then never added to the hash finally saved.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3334, #3308][reported by C.Peck, wm.edu and D. Stefano] Dump of bouncers would only return the first 25 entries.
	src/tools.pl: [#3499][reported  by R.Morvan] Prevent sympa.pl to crash while processing malformed multipart command message.  Error message is "Can't call method "effective_type" on an undefined value".
	Now tools::as_singlepart() does not recurse with an undefined $msg parameter.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: sympa was not able to create missing picture directory in a recursive way

	src/Log.pm: [#3137][Reported by M. Walther, Sun] Error in SQL request for web logs visualization. "GROUP BY" was used instead of "ORDER BY".
	
	web_tt2/rss.tt2: [#2959] [proposed by  Luoh Ren-Shan] escape sensible chars in RSS title

	soap/SympaTransport.pm, src/task_manager.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Some Sympa processes did not initialize the List.pm cache between 2 requests. It could lead to false responses from these processes that still used the cache in memory.

	web_tt2/menu.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3541] The code and web templates have been changed to still provide the list of topics, even though the default_home is set to 'lists'.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3466] Could no more change user's email from the preference page.

	wwsympa/bounced.pl: [Reported by M. Anderson, riseup.net] Sympa didn't support ARF format correctly. errors were thrown when Original-Rcpt-To field was missing, though this field is optional. We now separate two steps of control: the Feedback-Type field value control and the Original-Rcpt-To field value control.

	wwsympa/bounce-lib.pl: [Submitted by M. Quintero, North Central College, Naperville, IL] Bounces from Postfix were not always properly spotted due to a bad identification of the postfix bounce message. Fixed by extending the regexp to match a new kind of message.

	mail_tt2/listmaster_notification.tt2, src/List.pm: [#3272][Reported by M. Anderson, riseup.net] In some cases still to elucidate, the "verp_rate" parameter trailing percent sign disappears before being use. This would mak sympa crash. We now return undef if this parameter hasn't the right structure.

	web_tt2/main.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#2222] RSS feeds for web archives and shared documents are only proposed if access to these contents is available and public. This is required because RSS does not provide authentication methods.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3397] while running change_email(), don't try to update the member in DB if new email address is already member of the list.

	src/Conf.pm, src/sympa.pl, task_manager.pl, tools.pl: [#3234] Bounces in spool/bounce/OTHER/ were never cleaned up. Cleaning is now intergrated into the "expire_bounce" task, and the existence duration of such bounces is ruled by a new parameter : clean_delay_queueother.

	soap/sympasoap.pm, src/Commands.pm: [#1287] ADD commands are now rejected if user is already member. This will prevent multiple welcome messages to be sent.

	src/Family.pm: [Reported by D. Lalot, univ. Aix-Marseille] Opening XML files when instantiating families would make Sympa crash under Debian Etch. Fixed by switching "<:utf8" opening mode to "<:raw".

	src/Family.pm, src/List.pm: [#3528][Reported by D. Lalot, univ. Aix-Marseille] A list created by family instantiation without "config_changes" file in its directory would be set to status "error_config". Now, if the file is missing we assume that no changes occur. We still set the list in status error_config if the file exists but can't be opened.
	**Same behaviour implemented with the file "param_constraint.conf".**

	mail_tt2/invite.tt2: [Reported by M. Bouissou] Invite message suggested to reply to the message to accept to subscribe to a list. This led to an answer with "unknown command" error. Fixed by removing this message and giving an answer address and an appropriate subject string for people who couldn't hit the "mailto" link.

	src/sympa.pl: [Reported by M Bouissou] Command "quit" was ignored in mail commands. This was due to the correction of bug fix in Rev 3548: "Commands starting with 'qui' would be skipped, including QUIET". Fixed by removing comments and changing the regexp to match lines containing 'quit', 'stop', 'end' or '-' ONLY.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3661][Reported by S. Kristofferesen, univ. Oslo] In-Reply-To header did not follow rfc2822 format: opening '<' and closing '>' were missing.

	src/tools.pl: [Reported by C. Andrews, Boston College] Ampersand character was forbidden in email addresses though it is authorized by the RFC 2822.

	web_tt2/copy_template.tt2: [#3032][Submitted by J. Kirkland] It was impossible to copy a template through wwsympa to a language-specific directory because the lang was no passe as argument to Sympa. Fixed by modifying the template.

	web_tt2/serveradmin.tt2: All the radio buttons in the form used by the "set_log_level" action didn't share the same control name, thus preventing the web client from expliting them as a set of buttons. This prevented the value from being correctly processed.

	src/Datasource.pm: In a review, data sources name were not displayed because they were searched by comparing a MD5 hash on their parameters to the value stored in the database. As for complex datasources, these description were stored in hash, the order of the parameters was not fixed, leadinf to different values of MD5 for the same data sources. Fixed by sorting the hashes according to the hash keys, storing the result into an array and computing the MD5 with the array.




5.4a.4		25 September 2007

   
   New features :

	New session management : introduction of http session in order to replace a lot of cookies, for better user interface and security.
	  -new table session_table
	  -new module SympaSession.pm
	  -new features
	  - from admin page set log level for the current session
	  - from admin page list active sessions
	  - from admin page change user email identity
	  -new task to purge old sessions from table (inactive delay to remove session is set by the sympa.conf parameter session_expiration_period (defaul 1 month)

	  -cookie lang replaced by a session parameter
	  -cookie sympa-user removed
	  -Crawler detection is controled by /etc/crawlers_detection.conf.

	src/Log.pm: Added "trace" log facility to facilitate development messages insertion, visualization and deletion.

   Changes :

	check_perl_modules.pl, src/tools.pl, src/tt2.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: XSS protection: Any output web parameter is filtered 
	to avoid creation of XSS vector. Change:Additionnaly, any HTML file put in the shared directory is filtered using StripScripts.
	Change:HTML::StripScripts::Parser CPAN module is now mandatory.

	src/Conf.pm: [requested by JM.Martins da Cruz] Added X-Sympa-To and X-Family-To header fields to those header that should be
	removed by Sympa for outgoing mails

	web_tt2/home.tt2: Moved the search list form to the top of the Sympa home page.

	Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in, src/sympa_wizard.pl, wwsympa/Makefile, wwsympa/wwslib.pm,
	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: icons are now included in the sympa static content directory. Consequently, the
	"--with-iconsdir" configure option and the "icons_url" wwsympa.conf parameter are no longer used. The default path to
	icons is now {sympa home}/static_content/icons and the default icons URL is http://host/icons/.

	src/tools.pl: refined Simple XSS filter. Don't ding on simple "<" only, but on <script, <meta and <fdfds javascript:

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: Web archive search is now performed by default in the whole archive instead of just the current month.

	src/Upgrade.pm, src/etc/script/create_db.Pg, src/etc/script/create_db.mysql: added indexs on email
	column in both admin_table and subscriber_table. Also changed the order of column in CREATE INDEX directives.

	src/Conf.pm, wwsympa/SympaSession.pm: taskmanager remove anonymous sessions if older then anonymous_session_table Sympa
	conf parameter

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [M.Massar, univ Kaiserslautern] : Sympa is now able to get the Email in SubjAltName. As I
	was not able to find the mentioned patch to mod_ssl to get SSL_CLIENT_S_EMAIL exported, I wrote another patch based on SSL_CLIENT_CERT 
	from "SSLOptions +ExportCertData". REAPPLY the patch that had been removed.

	src/Conf.pm: css_url default value is now static_content/css/current_robot. This make it possible to set a
	single Apache Alias directive for static_content, shared by all virtual hosts.

	src/List.pm: optimization to skip some code in List::load()

	src/sympa.pl: [suggested by T.Berry, NASA] Changed the process identifier in the logs from (message) to (distribute)

   Bug fixes :

	src/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: changes of scenario from the admin web interface did not seem to work because the
	'selected' attributes were cumulated in %Scenario::all_scenarios. Now only pass the required scenario attributes (name and web_title) 
	to the TT2 web parser.
	
	src/Scenario.pm: [#3306][Reported by C. Andrews, boston College] The List::verify resolution of the true test would be applied for
	all custom conditions that have "true", "any" or "all" in them. Fix: Checks that condiotn starts and ends with the serached condition name.

	soap/sympasoap.pm, src/admin.pm, src/sympa.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: info and config files were not properly encoded 
	when a list was created using the web or SOAP. fixed by adding the declaration of origin in create_list_old call
	and then testing this value to know how to handle encoding.

	wwsympa/Auth.pm: [#3183][] : Trusted application name check was case sensitive, xhreas it is not supposed to be the case.
	Fixed by lowercasing comparison in remote_app_check_password().

	src/Language.pm: [#3269][Submitted by J. Ãstman, Helsinki univ.of technology]: sympa would take the LANGUAGE environment
	variable as its default instead of its lang parameter value, because this is Gettext default behaviour.

	src/Conf.pm, src/Family.pm, src/List.pm, wwsympa/bounce-lib.pl: [#3271][Reported by M. Anderson, riseup.net] 
	"$/" value was changed in several places without using a proper "local" operator to prevent system-wide field seperator contamination.

	src/Conf.pm: robot-specific 'static_content_path' parameter was never used to build 'css_path' parameter value.

	wwsympa/archived.pl: [reported by Alaxa]: rebuild() subroutine did not include code to create index file if missing

	soap/sympasoap.pm: "use strict" into "use strict vars" to prevent "Can't use string xx as a subroutine ref while strict
	refs" error

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by C.Peck, wm.edu] dump of bouncers would only return the first 25 entries

	src/List.pm: [reported by Y.Blusseau]: include_remote_file feature was not supported to include owners or editors.

	src/List.pm: [reported by Y.Blusseau]: $include_file was altered before _load_include_admin_user_file() calls.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: missing ',' in check_list_authz() call. The change_email action could therefore never succeed.

	wwsympa/bounce-lib.pl: [reported by R.Levo, J.Hopkins university]: some rfc1891 compliant bounces were not correctly parsed,
	whenever the "Status" line included the status code + additional comments. The regular expression has been extended.

	soap/sympasoap.pm: [reported by O.Berger, INT]: typo in List::store_susbscription_request() would make
	sympa_soap_server.fcgi die while receiving a subscription request with moderated subscription.
	The "use strict" pragma has been added and many other typos have been fixed.

	src/Upgrade.pm: [reported by C.Peck, William and Mary university]: Upgrade process could make subscribers
	unsubscribeable. The subscribed_subscriber DB field was first set to 1 but then turned into 0 (because of an old enum2int problem).
	Changed the order of the upgrade processes.

	src/Conf.pm: [A.Hicks, Persistent Objects]: css_url and css_path are not being set from the main config if they do not
	exist in the robot config as they are being set before the static_content_* checks

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: 'send_me' feature was broken because of an incorrect regexp on 'month' parameter

	src/Upgrade.pm: [reported by J.M.Martins de Cruz]: incorrect Language::SetLang() calls while migrating create_list_templates
	and families to UTF-8

	src/etc/script/create_db.Oracle: [reported by F.Lachapelle,Sophos]: incorrect index name

	src/admin.pm: [#3229][reported by T.Berry, NASA]: Sympa did not perform a lock before list config file was created/updated.
	This could leed to corrupted config files

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: no more use the buggy regexp $tools::regexp{'html-free'}. It would regexp any string
	containing '60' or '3c'

	po/check_locales.pl, src/Language.pm: [reported by JG.Pailloncy, O.Girard and JMM. da Cruz] : setlocale() failed on FreeBSD
	because locales syntax were not standard (ll_CC.ISO8859-N instead of ll_CC.ISO-8859-N). Now using utf-8 as encoding, thus solving
	the problem. Also changed the algorithm used by check_locales.pl to be the same as Language::SetLang()


5.4a.2		7 August 2007

   New features :

	src/List.pm: Added distribution_ttl parameter which will be used when an action should check if a sync_include is needed
	prior to be executed.

	src/List.pm: When sending a message, Sympa now checks whether the last include is older than ttl OR distribute_ttl if
	this one is defined. If it is, sychronization is done.

	soap/sympasoap.pm, src/Commands.pm, src/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: removes "sync_include" task when a synchronization 
	is triggered by another event than task processing.
	Review actions on list using includes trigger a user's list synchronization.

   Changes :

	src/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: added a new Robot package inside List.pm. Also optimized List::get_lists() to cache
	the results within a session and prevent multiple browsing of the expl/ directory

	soap/sympasoap.pm, src/Commands.pm, src/List.pm, src/Makefile,src/Scenario.pm, src/sympa.pl, web_tt2/d_control.tt2,
	web_tt2/edit_list_request.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: new Scenario.pm module. The way autorization are loaded has changed :
	they are now stored in a central place, ie a single copy of a scenario is stored if 2 lists use it. This should make the sympa
	processes consume less memory when running lots of lists. The scenario are now reloaded whenever they change on disk, except
	for operations that require good performances (like the 'lists' command). Inclusion of third party scenarios is now performed at
	evaluation time (in request_action()) and not while loading the scenario as it used to be.

*****	user_data_source values of 'file' and 'database' are no more supported. A migration precedure is run during the upgrade process
*****	This change will allow to optimize the code where 'file' user_data_source still had to be supported

	check_perl_modules.pl: [reported by S.Hornburg] remove unuseful dependency for Crypt::OpenSSL::X50 perl module. It was
	introduced in revision 3754.

	soap/sympasoap.pm, src/List.pm, src/Upgrade.pm, src/etc/script/arc2webarc.pl, src/etc/script/mod2html.pl,
	src/etc/script/p12topem.pl, src/sympa.pl, src/task_manager.pl, wwsympa/archived.pl, wwsympa/bounced.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi:
	Now set List::use_db in Upgrade::Probe_db() and List::check_db_connect() to prevent "Sympa not setup for DBI" errors.

	check_perl_modules.pl: Sympa requires Perl 5.8 (for encoding features)

	src/task_manager.pl: check the $end variable before processing each task, thus making a kill -TERM more quickly
	processed

	src/Log.pm, subst.pl: optimizations to save most calls to do_log()

	src/List.pm: optimizations to lower the List::new() calls and perform locks on list config files only if reloading is
	required

   Bug fixes :

	wwsympa/wwslib.pm: [#2931][A.GAVARA, INPL Nancy] CAS authentication would fail because http was used instead of https.
	Fixed get_my_url() to use HTTPS environment variable instead of SSL_PROTOCOL and SSL_PROTOCOL_VERSION.

	src/task_manager.pl: [#3142][submitted by Y. BLUSSEAU] A typo made the stop() command fail to remove tasks.

	soap/sympasoap.pm: [Reported by P. David, univ. Strasbourg] In some very rare occurences, the session identifier would be
	constituted of decimal numbers only AND start with at least one "0" (zero) character. In this case, this string was considered a
	number by sympasoap.pm and the zero removed, thus shortening - and invalidating - the id. This would prevent the user from being
	authorized to see pages in the wiki.

	soap/sympasoap.pm: Avoid potentially forged cookie from SOAP client.
	
	src/List.pm, src/mail.pm: use 'warning' log level instead of 'warn'

	src/Family.pm, src/admin.pm: config files generated by instantiate_family were not UTF-8 but ISO. Now opening files as
	UTF-8.

	soap/sympa_soap_client.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: sympa_soap_client.pl now takes into account the "--service" and
	"--service_parameter" arguments for "play_soap()" function.

	src/tools.pl, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#2960][Reported by L. Ren-Shan] First attempt at XSS prevention. Now prevents such
	intrusions in the web interface.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by Alessio] : a security problem would allow a user to directly access arctxt/* files or
	.mhonarc.db files. A %in_negative_regexp hash has been added to define forbidden expressions in parameters. XSS-related code has
	also been changed.


5.3.2		13 June 2007

   Bug fixes :

	/src/List.pm : logic for setting 'keep_trying' option to SQLSource::connect() was upside down. As a result, initial DB creation could not happen.

	/src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2 : [#3126][Reported by E. Koblinger, uhulinux.hu] Removed "keepspace" option from MIME options to avoid inclusion of useless "&nbsp;" sequences.

	/web_tt2/home.tt2 : [reported by R.Touchais] No more refer to a URL on the front page


5.3		22 May 2007

   New features :

	/src/Conf.pm, /wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi,/wwsympa/cookielib.pm : [proposed by P.Schober, Univ Vienna] added logout feature to generic_sso. This required adding a new sympa_sso_id HTTP cookie to keep track of which SSO was used to login. Also reorganized the cookielib subroutines.

   Changes :

	/web_tt2/login_menu.tt2, /web_tt2/loginbanner.tt2:  replaced the "magic authentication" with the SSO service name, defined in auth.conf.

	/src/List.pm: [#3097]: moved the code that remove SMTP header fields (defined by the remove_headers parameter) before the archiving code.

	/src/Upgrade.pm: [requested by S.Amrani, Gendarmerie Nationale] Change: probe_db() would previously alter DB field format if different from the expected format. Now accept fields with a size larger than expected.

   Bug fixes :
	
	/check_perl_modules.pl : [#3107][E.Koblinger, uhulinux] DBI 1.48 is required by use of selectall_hashref()

	/src/List.pm, /src/Message.pm: [reported by T.Berry, NASA] Empty Subject field were replaced with 'Charset'. This seems to be a MIME::EncWords::decode_mimewords() bug. Also fixed problems with custom subject parsing that was still using the old
parser::parse_tpl().

	/src/bouncequeue.c, /src/familyqueue.c, /src/queue.c: [#2945][D.Jahnke-Zumbusch] queue, bouncequeue and familyqueue scripts were removing the first "From xx" line found even though it was not part of SMTP headers. This caused problems with Postif if the 'F' flag was not set in master.cf, because postfix would not add the expected "From xx" Header field to the delivered message.
	The code has been fixed to look for the "From xx" in the first line of the message only.

	/src/tt2.pl: [#3086 Submitted by S. Hornburg, linuxia.de] When Sympa failed to create a template object, the last system error was displayed instead of the last Template error.

	/src/tools.pl: [#3075] file were renamed with a parasite '\'

	/src/List.pm: [Submitted by M. Gaudet, EHESS] Encoding problems when upgrading from versions of pre-all-UTF-8 era. config files were saved into UTF-8 without character conversion which messed list subjects and some admin values.

	/src/Upgrade.pm: [Reported by M. Gaudet, EHESS] Resolves encoding problems for lists' info files when upgrading from version 4.1.5 in lists where no 'filesystem_encoding' parameter was set.

	/src/List.pm: Definition of a default LDAP port (389) for include_ldap_xxx was leeding Sympa to use 389 port for LDAPS (instead of 636 port)

	/src/Upgrade.pm: [deb#418836][Reported by O. Berger, INT] Fix: SHOW FIELDS failed while upgrading. Now removing the dbname part in the tables() return value.

	/src/List.pm: [T.Berry, NASA] "Undefined subroutine &Task::list_tasks called at /usr/local/jpl/msg/list/sympa/bin/List.pm line 12333". The new version of List::purge() uses Task::list_tasks() subroutine but a "use Task" pragma is missing in List.pm.

	/src/List.pm: Error "Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference" while processing digests. Fixed the parameter loading procedure to handle correctly defaults (structured parameter with no default in subentries)

	src/aliaswrapper.c, src/virtualwrapper.c: [reported by L.Garnier, CNRS] added missing include of stdlib.h

	src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2, wwsympa/archived.pl: [#3013][submitted by P. Timmons, Ec. Polytechnique Montreal] : The button "toggle selection" 
	did not trigger its action and produced a javascript error instead. Plus added some pod documentation.

	web_tt2/css.tt2: [#2975]removed a '{' in excess at the end of file which would cause two javascript errors at each page loading 
	("Selector expected. Invalid rule set ignored." and "unexpected end of file while looking for closing } of an invalid rule set."). 
	Leaving IE proprietary "zoom" property. Must be useful in some way.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#3012][submitted by P. Timmons, Ec. Polytechnique Montreal] Robot listmaster couldn't edit scenarios due to the $robot parameter not being called by is_listmaster() function in do_dump_scenario().

	Added the missing parameter to &tools::qencode_hierarchy()

	src/tt2.pl: [#1464][submitted by S. Ikeda] [patch sympa-MAIN-20070103-escape_url.patch] Some MUAs aren't able to decode ``%40'' (escaped ``@'') 
	in e-mail address of mailto: URL, or take ``@'' in query component for a delimiter to separate URL from the rest.

	src/List.pm, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [#1075] Default values for parameter 'reply_to_header' are now correctly loaded.

	web_tt2/edit_list_request.tt2, wwsympa.fcgi: [#985]: Hide "update" button whenever no parameter can be edited in the current page

	[reported by R.Caldwelr, Franklin university] wwsympa::is_ldap_user() would not use provided bind_dn and bind_password.
	Change: New LDAPSource module to gather all LDAP-related code. Currently only connect() and disconnect() have been implemented.
	Change: removed obsolete export_list() functions (+related)


5.3b.4		13 March 2007

	forbid \n in most of them.


5.3b.3		7 February 2007

   New features :

	argument, and an extra argument representing date/time.  MHonArc resource file was modified so that it may generate output
	including this filter spec as nessessity.

	  Note that this spec will be available for newly-updated archives. To apply this improvement to all past archives, it is nessessary
	  that all archives are rebuilt.

	web_tt2/arcsearch.tt2: [A.Bernstein] [ID 899] Minor bugs and cosmetic improvements 
	in archive search results 
	1. In the presentation of search results in the archive, the listing of parameters that 
	was used for the search is incorrect because of various typos in the arcsearch.tt2 file.
	2. Search results are hard to read because messages blend together, so I've made minor changes 
	(making them list elements), and also added some linebreaks and removed some confusing
	feedback (the "Results" lines at the bottom).

	web_tt2/arcsearch_form.tt2: [A.Bernstein] [ID 900] Cosmetic reorganization of the archive advanced 
	search page

	doc/sympa.tex.tpl: Added comments about the requirements on the aliases file

	web_tt2/suboptions.tt2: [A.Bernstein] Subscribers can now edit their gecos on a list

	src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2: now provide archives mass-deletion also from the threaded page

	src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2: [A.Bernstein] [ID 905] The threaded view is more useful 
	if you can see the date of each message in the list.	This requires both adding the date 
	field to a few lines in mhonarc-ressources.tt2 and adding two new resources that weren't 
	customized at all before.

	po/: en_US.po, fr.po: use sympa.pot as the default en_US.po

	po/en_US.po, src/Language.pm: changed charset for English from us-ascii to utf-8

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [M.Massar, univ Kaiserslautern] Sympa is now able to get the Email in SubjAltName.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by S.Amrani, Gendarmerie Nat.] After editing a subscriber email, 
	the list owner might get a "not subscribed to list" error.  The bug happened because the do_set() 
	is used by both list members and list owners. Wwsympa now used the previous_action information to 
	bring the user back to the right page.

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by P.Von Der Hagen, Karlsruhe Univ.] [ID 876] 
	Sympa sends message "topics have changed" when owner is changed

	variable in mail report

	src/sympa.pl: [reported by S.Amrani, Gendarmerie Nat.]  sympa.pl would die when processing

	call" Fixed a buggy call to chomp.

	src/sympa.pl: [requested by P.Farmer, ZVENO] [ID 828] on OS X 10.3 scripts can't change their 
	real UID.  Now checking that the UID change succeeded.

	for thread view When viewing an archive in threaded order, the first/previous/next/last buttons 
	all return incorrectly to chronological view.  This happens because the line in the 
	mhonarc-ressources.tt2 that creates these buttons is an exact copy of the one from the chronological 
	view section, with "PREVPGLINK" and "NEXTPGLINK" instead of "TPREVPGLINK" and "TNEXTPGLINK".

	mail_tt2/send_auth.tt2: [reported by W.Werner, Fraunhofer]  When using x509 list certificates, 
	reply-to would be forced to list-request.  Added a reply-to header field to the send_auth.tt2 template

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by JM.Bourdin, IUFM Dijon] visibility authorization scenario was not 
	evaluated to compute the "your lists" box.

	src/List.pm: [BugID 750] include_sql_query requests would fail with Oracle.  
	Apparently the ->rows() method does not return the number of rows.  We now use fetchrow_arrayref() 
	to get rows, thus allowing to differenciate an empty field an the last row.

	wwsympa/bounce-lib.pl: analyze the 'Original-recipient' entries of message/delivery-status MIME parts

	src/etc/mhonarc-ressources.tt2: [proposed by E.Hood] now using $FROMADDRNAME$@$FROMADDRDOMAIN$ instead of $FROMADDR$. See

*****	CREATE TABLE admin_table (
*****	list_admin              varchar(50) NOT NULL,
*****	user_admin              varchar(100) NOT NULL,

*****	profile_admin           enum('privileged','normal'),
*****	PRIMARY KEY (list_admin, user_admin,role_admin),

*****	);

   New features :

*****	We have both changed Sympa's template format and catalogue format
*****	
*****	Template file format is now TT2 (hhtp://www.tt2.org). Its format is similar

*****	from an old version and will run the tpl2tt2.pl script to migrate your
*****	existing .tpl files to .tt2 format.
*****	
*****	We now use PO format for Sympa internationalization. This is a much more
*****	standard format which make it easier for translators to update catalogues.
*****	Because we could not automatically extract translatable strings from templates
*****	most of the translation job is to be done again and only 3 languages are supported 
*****	with this release (the one that have uptodate PO files)

***** 	If you are using MySQL, Sympa.pl will change the database structure

***** 	structure according to the provided create_db.x scripts.

	Incorrect listname regexp in task_manager (ingnored lists with '+').  Now centralized regexps in tools.pl

   Bug fixes :

	src/List.pm: [K.Marrocco] incorrectly refers to column "attributes" instead of "attributes_user" (for Oracle)

	src/Archive.pm, wwsympa/archived.pl: [BugID 273] [C.Nahaboo]  filenames in archived spool
	(outgoing) were using current time and PID which is not enough when 2 messages for the same list are sent

4.0.a6		18 September 2003

   New features :

	src/Commands.pm, src/List.pm, src/sympa.pl: new variable available in authz scenarios :
	[msg_encrypted] is set to 'smime' if message was S/MIME encrypted

	src/: Conf.pm, List.pm, tools.pl: [C. Mock] : 
		-allow separate signing/encryption S/MIME keys for users, lists, 
		sympa; keys are extracted from the received signed emails, analyzed
		for the key usage extensions, and saved either as before (when they
		allow signing and encryption) or with a file extension
		"@enc"/"@sign" for separate keys; cf extract_certs() in tools.pl
		for saving them, parse_smime_cert() for getting all the info out
		(this also encapsulates the issue of email addresses in the DN vs
		SubjectAlternativeName), and find_smime_keys() to encapsulate the
		decision which key to use for signing, encrypting and decrypting.
		wwsympa has been altered accordingly to deliver either the
		encryption certificate or the "both purposes certificate" from
		"load cert".  

		- allow multiple "generations" of certificates for
		lists + sympa, so that you can renew your certs before they expire
		and run old and new certs alongside, so you don't need all your
		users to switch at the very same moment; this is also encapsulated
		in find_smime_keys().
  
   Changes :

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [C. Mock] Change: patched mod_ssl to extract the  SubjectAlternativeName 
	X509 email storage variant and deliver it in $ENV{SSL_CLIENT_S_EMAIL}; this is checked in wwsympa
	in preference to $ENV{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_EMAIL}; need this for our certificates which contain the 
	email address _only_ in the SubjectAlternativeName.


   Bug fixes :

	wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [C. Mock] Fix: set content-type of list cert depending on user-agent, 
	so IE can automatically import the file too; also, send CRLF terminated certificates with the
	certificate itself only (no comment lines), also for IE. Certificate installation from the web 
	interface works for netscape and IE now.

	src/Commands.pm,src/sympa.pl: [C. Mock] Remove unusefull SMIME code, performed in Message.pm


4.0.a5		12 September 2003

   New features :
	
	Sympa can rely on CAS single sign-on system (Yale central Authentication Service)
	for authenticating users. Check auth.conf section in documentation for more details.
	Sympa first tries a transparent login, if it did not succeed, it then prompts the user
	for his favourite CAS server.
*****	auth.conf format has changed ; if you had a previous auth.conf file you 
*****	should change it according to the new format
*****	To keep the existing authentication bahovior you should add the following entries at the
*****	end of your existing auth.conf file :
*****		    user_table
*****		    regexp                 .*


   Changes :

	doc/: Reorganize documentation with authN and authZ chapters

	doc/sympa.tex.tpl: Change: rename 'scenario' to 'authorization scenario'
	

4.0.a4		14 August 2003

		* process_bouncers will either notify or remove them  The list config defines 2 bouncing
		levels (rate, action and notification).
*****	You should update your database structure based on the create_db.xxx scripts
*****	unless you are using MySQL (Sympa tries to update the database automatically at startup)

	New purge_orphan_bounces task that removes archived bounces files concerning old subscribers

   Changes :

3.3.6b.2	31 July 2002

   New features :

	###############################################################
	New 'include2' user_data_source ; should replace 'include'.
	Users cache is stored in the main database instead of using a 
	DB_File. Updates of the cache are performed by the task_manager

	* Advantages

        	+ lower memory usage :
        	Sympa processes used to use lots of memory when managing
        	big (>200 000) 'include' types of lists. The list of 
        	subscribers is now stored in the database.

        	+ updating the cache :
        	Cache update is now performed by the task manager. It used to
        	be performed by sympa.pl and wwsympa.fcgi.

        	+ bounces management : 
        	Because included users now have an entry in subscriber_table,
        	their bounces are managed like any other subscribed users

        	+ user reception options :
        	Included users can set their reception mode

	* Subscriber_table changes

		The subscriber_table Db table has 3 new fields :

        	  	* included_subscriber
        		This boolean value tells if the user has been included into
        		the list

        		* subscribed_subscriber
        		This boolean value tells if the user has subscribed to the
        		list

        		* include_sources_subscriber
        		Comma-separated list of include source IDs. It is not 
        		exploited yet, but could be used to :
                	  - set different TTL for each include data_sources
                	  - show include sources in the REVIEW pages
                	  - tell the user he/she has been included as part
                	  of X,Y external datasources

	* Task manager 

	New 'sync_include' list task : 
	Only one model (ttl) is available. TM checks if the list is
	in 'include2' mode and runs the sync_include. The syn_include()
	does an in-memory comparison of already cache users list and
	included users list ; subscriber_table is then updated. 	
	List::delete_user() and List::add_user() have been optimized
	to make sync_include() faster.
	A new task is created based on 'ttl' list parameter.

	New 'purge_user-table' global task :
	Each time a user unsubscribes the user_table had to be cleaned ;
	this was time-consuming. This is now performed periodically
	by the 'purge_user-table' task. 


	* Changes of commands behavior

	Reception options 
	Included users can now set their reception mode

	Subscription
	Included users can moreover subscribe to the list (if allowed by scenario).
	It allows them to remain in the list though they might no more be included.

	Review (web only)
	Foreach user, tell if he/she is included or subscribed


	* Locking while updating cache

	An exclusive lock is performed by sync_include() to prevent other processes
	from accessing an uncomplete list of users. A shared lock is set in 
	List::get_first_user(), then released for the last List::get_next_user().
	File locking is performed on ~sympa/expl/<list>/include.lock file

	* Stats file 

	A new value has been added to lists 'stats' file : last_sync
	I is the date (epoch format) of the last include cache update.

	* List configuration edition

	When the list configuration has been changed (from the web), then :
	        * if we changed a datasource-related parameter
        	=> the current 'sync_include' task is removed from the task
        	spool, to make cache update happen as soon as possible.

        	* if user_data_source changed from 'database' to 'include2'
        	=> existing subscribers have their 'subscribed_subscriber' DB
        	field set to '1'

        	* if user_data_source changed from 'include2' to 'database'
        	=> existing included users are purged from subscriber_table

	* TODO

        + sending messages when users are included/decluded (should be an option)
        + migrating from 'include' to 'include2'
        + showing user datasources within REVIEW page
        + adding "sort by datasource" in REVIEW page
	#####################################################################

	database structure has	been extended for 'include2' user_data_source

3.3a-vhost.10   25 Sep 2001

   New features : 
   
        Sympa at last implements virtual robot :

	  Sympa virtual robots are likely Apache virtual hosting : a single
          daemon sympa.pl and a single cgi server wwsympa.fcgi now
          can serve multiple domains with their own set of list, templates
          and scenarii.
	
	  All configuration parameters can be define for each robot except
          Sympa installation parameters such as binary and spool location,
          SMTP engine, antivirus plugging etc. 

          A robot is named by its domain, and defined by a directory 
          ~sympa/etc/somedomain.org. This directory must contain 
          a robot.conf file that defines the virtual robot parameters
          http_host  title  default_home lang listmaster max_size and colors.

          ~sympa/etc/dom.org/ contains lists of dom.org robot

          ~sympa/etc/dom.org/wws_templates/, ~sympa/etc/dom.org/templates/,
          ~sympa/etc/dom.org/scenari/ directories are applied when loading
          templates or scenarii before searching into ~sympa/etc and 
          ~sympa/bin/etc. 
       
          Check sample dir.

        [Florent Guilleux]: Task manager
          wwsympa/wws_templates/fr/edit_list_request.fr.tpl
          Various task automatic processing. List master may use predefined
          task models to automate recurrent processings such as regurlaly
          reminding subscribers their belonging to a list or updating
          certificate revocation lists. It is also possible to write one's
          own task models to  meet particular needs. Unique actions may also
          be scheduled by this way.
             
        Sympa.pl recognize SIGHUP to reload sympa.conf, all sympa.conf
        parameters are reloaded except those related to syslog. In addition
        each HUP received change the value of the -mail option. 

        New variable 'is_bcc' available in scenario ; it is set to 1
	if the list was NOT mentioned in To: or Cc:
	This provides a usefull spam/viruses prevention

        You can define a set of common scenario rules, used by ALL LISTS.
	'include.<action>.header is automatically added to evaluated scenarios.

  Changes :
      
        Web interface colors are now defined in sympa.conf
      
        'reject' scenario action now accepts a template name as parameter

  Bug fixes :
  
        Forbid [] chars for shared documents

        STATS command controlled by "review" scenario
	
	List-specific invite.tpl was not used 'dir'. 
	List attribute is now an absolute path

        List config file contained strange 'default_user_options' entries.  
	&List::get_default_user_options() returns a reference ; 
	the value was changed when adding a subscriber, and might be saved later.
	
	Did not apply default_user_options while importing

        bouced.pl died if bounce file was empty

        bounced now die if it can't create file to store bounces. 
	This is needed to prevent the loop describe by Claus Atzenbeck.

        no login form is needed at all.

        data structure for list configuration. You must check that sympa.sympa
        has write access on config files.

        sophie.le-floch AT cru.fr is intended for new groupware features
        in WWSympa.
	
****	New design for web navigation. All web templates are changed. 3.0a

           containing the email address(es)
           o select <first | all> (default 'first') if the query
           returns multiple values, do we keep the first one or all of them

	Add a protection at the entrance of archives. If the user is
	not identified, he/she has to click a button to access archives.

	New parameter "visibility" for a topic in topics.conf
	It refers to "topics_visibility" scenario

	Check Message-IDs to avoid loops.

	"default_user_options" now applied to included users.

     	"reminder","invite"). These files have a ".tpl" extension. Global ones
     	are located in ~sympa/etc/templates/, list specific in ~sympa/expl/<list>/

     	A patch (patch.mailheader) has been proposed by the author of 
     	Mail::Internet

     	[reported Richard Balint <richard.balint AT notes.udayton.edu>]
     	Sympa died when openning an unknown scenario. Fixed by adding a

	to the menu.

     	Scenari for send parameter are available ! Check send.* in the 
     	scenari directory. The send scenari is paticular because you can
     	check headers in rules :  exemple.
      	  match ([header->Content-Type],/multipart/)  smtp -> editorkey
          (semantic is multipart messages must be approved by editor)

     	The list parameter "visibility" is performed by scenari. The goal
     	is to provide defferent lists of lists depending of the context
     	(mainly depending on the sender). The following exemple show how

	edit message, only listmaster can.

      	Changes in aliases : no more priority param is needed
      	(though old style remains compatible)

      	[proposed by Carsten Clasohm]

      	for comptability with case-sensitive DBMS such as PostgreSQL.

      	Correction of "match()" condition in scenari.

2.3Beta 9 September 1999

    New features :

      	Optional "info" parameter in owner/editor paragraphs, allowing 
      	to store private information (such as tel number) about these 
      	people.

      	In order to use MhOnac to make html archive, Sympa copy
      	all messages distributed in a list which config file
      	containt a "web_archive" paragraph in the "queueoutgoing"
      	parameter.

      	[proposed by Manuel Valente <mvalente AT france-cybermedia.fr>]
      	Requested by users not afraid to corrupt original MIME
      	content-type and encoding! "footer_type" parameter in list
      	config. May be "mime"(default) or "append".

      	[asked by Manuel Valente <mvalente AT france-cybermedia.fr>]
      	"message.header"[.mime] appended at the beginning of messages.

      	Commands del, add, sig, rev, info are now controled by scenari
      
*****  New syntax for condition in scenario rules.
***** This will affect your scenari if you write your own scenari
***** in previous versions. If so, check scenari from src/scenari dir.

      
    Changes :
       
      	[reported by Carsten Clasohm <clasohm AT rivalnet.com>]
      	Table names "user" and "subscriber" respectively become
      	"user_table" and "subscriber_table". This is needed because
      	of a conflict with "USER" keyword in PostgreSQL v 6.4
      	(Define USER as synonym for CURRENT_USER per SQL92 specs).

****** You need to change your database structure:
****** with MySQL :
******    ALTER TABLE user RENAME user_table;
******    ALTER TABLE subscriber RENAME subscriber_table;
******
****** with PostgreSQL :
******    ALTER TABLE user RENAME TO user_table;
******    ALTER TABLE subscriber RENAME TO subscriber_table;


      	[Dominique ROUSSEAU <rousseau AT neuronnexion.fr>]
      	List.pm is patched so PostgreSQL can be used to store internal

      	Info return the adminsitrative info about a list, not the
      	welcome message.

      	List::probe_db() does checking of database 
      
      	Sympa warns if it finds unexpected parameters in list config.

    Bug Fixes :
    
      	[reported by Michel BEHEREGARAY <Michel.Beheregaray AT univ-pau.fr>]
      	"include_ldap_query" are now correctly parsed by Sympa. There

      	Sympa did not keep messages detected as BAD-xxx
          (no from found, loop problems, ...)

      	Sympa now loads editors and owners GECOS 

      	Lists using includes now set correctly the scenario subscribe.closed

      	Sympa perfoms correctly list configuration comments in paragraph
      	mode. Warning when an unknown list parameter is found.

      	[reported by Dominique ROUSSEAU <rousseau AT neuronnexion.fr>]
      	No footer attachement if msg is multipart/alternative

      	[Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog AT hrnet.fr>]

2.2.7 22 June 1999

    Bug Fixes :

      	Fatal bug in HELP and WHICH commands for sites not using DBMs.
      	(Can't connect(DBI::dbname=sympa;host=  ), no database driver
      	specified)

      	Default scenari directory in Conf.pm

      	Reload $* and $/ after each dofile. It seem's to fix the 
      	bug specific to solaris ("No from found ..." for all messages
      	after a WHICH) !!!

2.2.6 17 June 1999

      	Messages welcome, removed, bye, reminder are parsed 
      	at runtime for variables instanciation. The following keystring
      	are parsed :
      	[listname] [subscriber_email] [sympa_email] [sympa_host]
      	Now you can use a single welcome message for all list :
      	"welcome to [listname], your  email is [subscriber_email]  ..."

      	The helpfile is now splitted into two files : helfile
      	and helpfile.advanced, only list owner and list editor will
      	receive bothg the helfile and the helfile.advanced section.
      	[sympa_email] is replaced by it value at runtime.
****** So you need to update your helpfile and create
****** helpfile.advanced, look in sample dir

      	"user_data_source include" allow multiple include sections

      	new include type :  include_list [listname]
                          include_file [path to a file]

      	(Mail::Header) 

      	Decoding of "_" in Q-coded subjects

      	From: header fields of reports from sympa respect «host» config
      	; files sent (welcome, bye,...) are from <listname>-request.
            

2.2.5	18 may 1999


      	"subscription" list parameter is now "subscribe" for simplification
      	("subscription" and "unsubscription" are still accepted).

      	Lists subject returned by LISTS was truncated to 4 lines. It is now
      	extended to 8 lines.

      	List params "reply-to" and "custom-header" are changed to "reply_to"

	sessions SMTP.

	Gestion des entêtes MIME (à définir à la fin de fr.msg).

0.009   10 décembre 1997

	Correction d'une erreur dans les expressions régulières de gestion des
	commandes : cela pouvait faire échouer l'usage de l'authentifieur dans
	certains cas très rares.

	Ajout de l'entête X-Loop et traitement visant à prevenir les boucles.

	Erreur dans le total du nombre d'abonnés : l'ajout d'un utilisateur
	n'était pas comptabilisé.

	Reply List ne fonctionnait pas dans certains cas en raison d'une faute
	de programmation.

0.008	15 novembre 1997

	Corrigé quelques bugs et rajout de l'option maxsmtp dans sympa.conf.

0.007   10 novembre 1997

	La modération était en avance sur son temps : on revient à la (mauvaise)
	vieille méthode (AtArticle to modérate).
	Corrections mineures dans les autres modules.
	Le fichier fr.msg a été corrigé et étendu.

0.006   15 septembre 1997

	Beaucoup de changements dans de nombreux modules, notamment un
	début d'écriture en objet pour certains d'entre eux. Quelques
	corrections de défauts. A se demander si on ne devrait pas
	appeler cela une béta de la version 2 de Sympa.


0.005	8 juillet 1997

	version.pl -> Version.pm      log.pl -> Log.pm

	La commande `get' fonctionne enfin.

	Certaines fonctions passent du module `tools' vers `list' où elles
	sont mieux à leur place.

	Bug dans list.pl lorsque le fichier des abonnés n'existe pas il faut
	refuser de charger la liste [signalé par Olivier Lacroix].

	La substitution remplace également le chemin vers le fichier de
	configuration définit dans le Makefile. Cela fonctionnait déjà
	pour le programme queue, mais par pour sympa.pl [O. Lacroix].

0.004	17 juin 1997

	La documentation évolue un peu.

	La commande reconfirm envoie un message aux abonnés qui n'ont pas
	confirmé leur abonnement à la liste depuis le délais indiqué en
	paramètre. Le troisième argument est le nombre de semaines de
	grâce (donné à titre indicatif). Ex : reconfirm tulp-fr 2 4.

	La commande purge permet de virer les abonnés qui n'ont pas
	renouvellé leur abonnement depuis le nombre de mois indiqué
	en argument. Ex : purge tulp-fr 2.

	L'authentification est maintenant supportée pour les commandes
	sub et sig : il faut mettre le drapeau `auth' dans le champ
	subscription du fichier de configuration (et non pas md5).

	Le paquettage MD5 (dans CPAN) n'est plus facultatif : vous devez
	l'installer pour utiliser Sympa.

	Correction de quelques bugs dans la gestion des entêtes
	[A. Thivillon].

0.003	13 juin 1997

	*** ATTENTION - IMPORTANT ***
	Pour utiliser Sympa vous devez installer le paquettage DB de
	Berkeley dans une version supportée par Perl (use DB_File),
	et il vous faut aussi installer MailTools (dans CPAN).

	Correction de 2 petits bugs de programmation [Alain Thivillon].
	Changement de la chaine de reconnaisance what(1) (bug signale
	par O. Robert).

	Utilisation de my a la place de local, usage de my devant $id (pour
	use strict) [O. Robert].

	La fonction "index" a été rajoutée et fonctionne.

	Le tri des abonnés se fait maintenant par un arbre binaire en
	utilisant le module DB_File. C'est beaucoup plus rapide pour
	les grandes listes.

	Le module rfc822.pl n'est plus nécessaire, il a été supprimé de
	la distribution. Le programme utilise maintenant Mail::Address
	(disponible dans CPAN).

0.002	19 mai 1997

	Ajout du nombre d'abonnés à la liste en dernière ligne de la
	commande Review.

0.001	1er avril 1997

	Première version de tests diffusée à un large public.
